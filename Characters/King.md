# King
King has enhanced strength and endurance, but what truly sets him apart is his ability to transfer any physical harm he sustains to other individuals: any person he has touched within a 24-hour period will receive either the full brunt of any damage he takes, or will receive a fraction of that damage proportional to the number of people he has touched. This power made him immune to the effects of Gray Boy's ability, which allowed King to control him. However, it was unable to protect him from Foil's charged shots, whose effects he could not displace. It is unknown if he can transfer things like over-exertion and other physical ailments into his "thralls".

Attacks that destroy the Corona pollentia are able to kill him.
