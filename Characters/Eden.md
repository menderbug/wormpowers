# Eden
Eden has similar abilities as The Warrior due to "multiple parallels" in their bodies and intelligence. Eden has the exact same Shards as the Warrior, though they were used differently. A key difference is that Eden is also The Thinker. It is largely her role to understand, emulate and manipulate the lives of the Humans on the multiple versions of planet Earth. She made use of simulations of the future to set and investigate criteria in order to achieve the goals of the Cycle. Part of her ability to simulate the future is given away.
