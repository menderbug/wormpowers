# Torso
Torso has a very powerful headbutt, capable of knocking a Titan over. He can only do this a limited number of times, at least when fighting enemies as powerful as Titan Eve. Victoria compared the effects of his headbutts to attacks from Scion since they managed to disable her forcefield for several seconds after shattering it with a light bump. Combined with his propensity to fall over it makes him burdensome to transport.

He has similar, All-or-Nothing grade of invulnerability, albeit it is limited to his head and torso.
 He is able to make his way through titan warzone despite his clumsiness. It also extends to master-effects with him being immune to The Simurgh's scream.

Presumably would be effective against Sleeper, given the ability to reach him.
