# Sifara
Sifara is a type of telekinetic, with the power to maintain spatial relationships, he is able to use this to counter Khonsu. His power requires him to have a strong reference with what he is working with. Preferably through touch for a strong connection but, failing that, eyesight could be used albeit not as effectively.
