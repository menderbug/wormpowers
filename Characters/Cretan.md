# Cretan
Cretan creates a labyrinth through non-euclidean space. Comparable to Vista and Labyrinth however he is restricted to simple unmovable surfaces. Unlike either of them he is physically imposing and has been known to engage in fistcuffs.

When using his power any building is twisted and inverted into a confusing, physics-breaking, space warping maze. He activates his power in pulses, with each wave warping the area further. His upper limit is unknown but Cretan has been seen using his ability to twist a large area, including several buildings, into a maze the size of a skyscraper.

Cretan himself seems able to manipulate the effect on the small scale within his radius to let him move through it.
