# Pagoda
Pagoda healed almost any damage done to him extremely rapidly, faster than Panacea is able to inflict damage with her power. His brain didn't feel pain properly, and he is immune to most Master effects since he is directly controlled by a metal framework inside his body.

Should Pagoda ever escape Bonesaw's control, his regeneration is to be put into reverse by an apparatus near his heart, killing him.
