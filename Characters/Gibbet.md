# Gibbet
Gibbet has a Shaker ability, which appears to spawn countless copies of objects that she pushes into the ground. These require her presence and attention to exist.

She prefers to use her ability with gallows and nooses, as these can be used to catch and snare people. They are useful in many ways of course. However she can replicate almost anything in an area, with the replications independent of the template after replication.

## Equipment
Gibbet carries an large if mobile gallows set up, complete with noose.
