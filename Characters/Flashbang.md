# Flashbang
Mark's power allows him to create bouncing orbs of light that can detonate either concussively (and largely non-lethal) or explosively with potentially lethal force. He can adjust the charges to control the size of the resulting explosion, re-absorb projectiles, and maintains a secondary power that allows him to ignore the effects of his own improvised weapons, He could create a large number of explosions.

Similar to Brandish, Flashbang has shown some resistance to blinding lights.

He is severely devastated by a brain injury, but is able to get around it thanks to Panacea's intervention.

## Equipment
He generally carries everything his team might need.
