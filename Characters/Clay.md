# Clay
Jess can produce a cone-shaped spray of liquid forcefield capable of covering roughly eight hundred square feet in seconds. It is initially fragile - breaking if the target is already moving at a walking pace - before setting to a consistency akin to sheet metal, capable of being bent or broken with exerted force at the edges. Further spray can layer the field for additional strength.

She manages the breadth and intensity of the spray by way of energy projection her power provides at the palm of her hands. Using these tools, she can keep the clay in a semiliquid state and mold it into simple, medieval constructions, or alter its properties to facilitate these constructions, or alter their fundamental properties. such as making the substance conductive to electricity or not. She maintains a Striker rating for her ability to use these projection tools as a CQC weapon.
