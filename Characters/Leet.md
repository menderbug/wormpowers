# Leet
Leet is a Free Tinker with access to all tinker technology trees, allowing him to theoretically create basically anything with sufficient blueprinting, resources, and time. However, Wildbow commented that people out-of-universe tend to overestimate his power.

Unfortunately for Leet, his inspiration method (i.e., how he manages and works with his ideas) comes with inherent and heavy drawbacks:

For any new project, he has to cross-check against everything he ever made, such as components, tinker-derived power sources, overall design and goal, mechanisms, and so on, to judge if they are all sufficiently different and if he should move forward. All throughout his tinker technology trees are entire sections where using a specific technology has a X% chance to fail. If he gets further away from one design, the chance drops, but it is still there. If he combines aspects from two tinker fields into a single project, the result will affect his misfire chances in both of the fields he bridges, though potentially not as much as usual.

By the time Leet figured these drawbacks out, he has burned many bridges during his experimentation, limiting his options and leading him to fail very often. He explicitly burnt himself out on biotinkering, robotics, and hard light holograms fairly early on. All together, this led to Leet becoming a laughingstock among other parahumans, though his technology could still be quite versatile when working correctly.

## Shard
Although Leet did not drink a Cauldron vial, his Shard is from Eden and is dead: the dead Shard attached itself to an unsuitable host. Behind the scenes, Leet is explicitly out of tune with it as he is both too risk-averse and methodical in his approach, with the resulting passivity irking the power granting Shard. His habit of staying in his workspace, maintaining lists of previous projects, and only going on preplanned outings means that the ideas and assistance his Shard should be granting him are consequently restricted, compared with tinkers that frequently get into fights.

The accumulation of misfire chances is inherent to his power; however, his Shard can tweak the actual misfires. Thus, the unsatisfied Shard sabotages Leet; misfires or failures are now more prone to causing chaos for him rather than setting him up to pursue it. By trying to actively disrupt Leet, it aims to either:

Both outcomes are acceptable to it.
