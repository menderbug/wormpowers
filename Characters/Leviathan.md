# Leviathan
## Macro-Hydrokinesis
Leviathan's main power (and by far is his most powerful) is the manipulation of water on a massive scale. He often preludes his arrival to his target with a torrential downpour and a tsunami, which he continuously creates throughout the battle. Each one of these waves is more powerful than the last, eventually becoming powerful enough to topple entire buildings. The frequency of these is dependent on whether he is able to focus his ability on them, meaning a sustained attack can delay them. He often uses these to cripple strategic areas like evacuation centers or and smaller ones to change the balance of the battlefield if he begins to lose the advantage.

However the true strength of this ability is to create extreme amounts of water pressure and movement in unseen places such as underground aquifers or coastlines. When Leviathan approached Brockton Bay, Legend informed capes that Brockton Bay is a vulnerable soft target where they could not afford to buy time and let Leviathan build up the strength of his attacks because the city is above an aquifer. He could manipulate this aquifer in an attempt to erode the surrounding sand, silt, and rock, having the end goal of collapsing a section or perhaps most of the city. If not stopped over the course of hours, Leviathan can eventually even sink or level entire islands as he demonstrated with the complete disappearance of Newfoundland and the shattered, half-sunken Kyushu.

The only weakness to this ability is that it lacks fine control. When working with relatively small amounts of water the best he can do is create shield-like geysers or send smaller waves to throw off opponents. This means he can't do things like manipulating water within the body or pinpoint high pressure drilling.

## After-Echo
Along with his hydrokinesis, Leviathan has an "echo" of water that appears whenever he moves. For any body part moved, voluntarily or being attacked, water will appear seemingly out of nowhere to fill the space in the air where that body part just is. This water will maintain the speed and direction of the area that created it, even if the movement of that area changes. For example if he whips his tail then quickly stops it, the water produced from that movement will continue forward at the same deadly speed as the tail is moving (something he uses to greatly increase the range of his attacks). Normal physics still apply to this water and it can be manipulated by him afterwards. However, it is possible for a sufficiently powerful hydrokinetic to deflect his ranged attacks.

## Super-Speed
Unrelated to his hydrokinesis, Leviathan has the ability to move at extremely fast speeds, allowing him to move around the battlefield faster than many individuals can retreat and rapidly dodge slower ranged attacks. He could climb a 5-story building fast enough that his momentum carried him 20 feet above the rooftop. On two legs, Leviathan can lunge forward at the speed of a locomotive and swipe his claws as fast as a speeding car. That said, non-speedsters such as Armsmaster can aim dodge Leviathan's swipes with the help of combat analysis software.

Leviathan crouching on all fours is typically an indication that he is preparing to charge into combat, relocate, or retreat. On all fours, he is fast enough to run on the surface of water despite weighing nearly nine tons. However, Clockblocker managed to tag a charging Leviathan with his power. It is also possible for non-speedsters to aim dodge his charge (e.g., Armsmaster with a grappling hook and combat analysis software).

If he chooses, Leviathan can run slower with a loping gait.

While underwater, he can use his hydrokinesis with his super-speed to move faster than normal. In a growing lake that is at least three city blocks across, Leviathan swam fast enough to essentially be a teleporter, finding the drowning and executing them. He can also swim underwater to relocate or retreat. However, Skitter could track his underwater movements as he could not accelerate or decelerate fast enough to kill her bugs via G-forces. Leviathan's swimming speed is not enough to dislodge a sufficiently ramped-up Lung holding onto his back and shoulders; Lung is less than 15 feet tall at the time.

A speedster, distinct from a flier, describes an individual that can move their body at a ridiculous pace using either a Breaker state, propulsion, environmental manipulation, or alien biology. While underwater, Leviathan could move far faster than any speedster on record as of May 15, 2011. The only known parahuman speedster faster than him is Secondhand; Secondhand is faster than light in his time-dilation state.

## Enhanced Strength
Although Leviathan is not as physically strong as Behemoth, he still has enhanced strength on the same level as Echidna. He can bend steel with his tail, rip a transformed Hookwolf in half, and claw away layers of armor from the  Cawthorne. Leviathan is strong enough to break through several steel columns (each 3-4 feet across) and a barrier of steel blades by pushing them. He pinned Alexandria to the ground and could hit hard enough to take Legend out of a fight.

Leviathan can pick up debris, capes, Bitch's dogs, and vehicles to hurl as projectiles.

## Fins
Following the Simurgh's upgrades to him in Gold Morning, Leviathan gained fins, which are just as tough as the rest of his body. They also sport nano-thorns, a blur of microscopic blades stolen from Defiant's design, which turns things to dust on contact. This is the reason the water around him turns to mist with the fins unfolded.

## Other Abilities
Leviathan has incredible durability and can regenerate thanks to his Endbringer physiology. He perceives the world as water.

Like other Endbringers, Leviathan cannot be predicted easily with the typical Thinker danger sense and is also a blind spot to the typical precognition, including Contessa. That said, Armsmaster's combat analysis software (with no interference and outside variables) genuinely worked against Leviathan by predicting his attacks, movement, counters, and tactics; Armsmaster lost the duel because he assumed his nano-thorn Halberd could fully cut through the Endbringer.
