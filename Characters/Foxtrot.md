# Foxtrot
Foxtrot is a pseudo-teleporter. She is able to cover great distances but she does not disappear while she is doing this. It is more like space warping. There seems to be a Thinker/Stranger component or a lot of practice to her repositioning, since it quickly and reliably provides her with advantageous angle on her target.

She is able to appear within buildings provided one of her targets is there. She usually relies on allies to get around people.
