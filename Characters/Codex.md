# Codex
Codex is a Blaster/Thinker hybrid that strikes anyone within its area of effect with permanent brain damage and memory loss in exchange for granting her a temporary boost to her mental power. Her area of effect can be seen in the glowing of her victims' eyes.  Her power affects a large area, penetrating both cover and armour.  It can almost be considered a Blaster/Shaker power instead.

According to Tattletale, Codex is good at administration, is a fantastic cook, and skilled when it comes to managing people, but not suited to the combat common of cape life which Accord agreed to.
