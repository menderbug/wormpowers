# Ahrima
According to Rain Ahrima has a danger sense and unspecified enhanced perceptions, and more importantly she can also gift it to others. She can only empower one person at a time but she can rapidly switch who has her power. People using her power are better able to evade attacks, dodging blows they shouldn't be able to see coming. Anyone under her empowerment has glowing yellow eyes. It is unknown what mechanism she uses to transfer her powers, if there is set up needed, or if she gets sensory feedback from people she's granted her power to. Similarly, it is unknown if by giving up her own Thinker enhancement she affects her normal senses or incapacitates herself. While empowering other combatants she's kept protected and away from the main fight, but that may simply be due to her value and lack of defensive powers rather than due to incapacitation.
