# Fume
Fume casts out large, baseball sized bullets that move with enough force to break bones, one from each hand per two or three seconds. These bullets, on striking a surface, produce a cloud of sulphurous gas. The gas has a smell comparable to rotten eggs or skunk, and produces an immediate, albeit mild burning sensation, particularly around the mucus glands.
