# Teacher
Teacher is able to give others an ability of his choice from a wide variety of Thinker and Tinker powers with a simple touch, with the disadvantage that the recipient becomes susceptible to Teacher's manipulation. In severe cases, his minions remained absolutely loyal to him as long as they has the granted powers. Teacher is able to intensify his power, making the granted ability stronger, but the power of an ability granted inversely correlates with diminished faculties in the subject, creating a dynamic where the more information a given 'student' possesses, the less able they are to express it. While Teacher has no constant connection to his students, he is able to sense both the power and the degree of influence he has over them. Teacher is able to change a student's abilities at any moment, but this becomes more difficult when an ability has has time to settle in.

In addition to his ability to grant powers, Teacher is able to modify existing ones, achieving more power at the expense of control, or vice versa. Teacher describes the process as first discovering the true nature of the power before using a sort of hypnotic state to unlock it, likening it to a second trigger.

Teacher's power decays over time. There have been almost no cases where Teacherâ€™s power lasted more than a few days without a refresher, with the brainwashing wearing off over a few weeks or months, but in at least one case the power remained active for several years without being refreshed, with the subject showing sign similar to addiction. Despite this, Teacher claims his methods are less invasive than actual brain tampering.

Teacher's students show a form of groupthink: While individual members appear normal at first glance, they actually work within a complex system, which Taylor compares to an RTS game or computer, with every individual carrying out a specific operation, gathered in clusters with people who communicate their ideas to others in efficient ways.

It is worth noting that Teacher does not give high-level Tinker powers. Rather, he pushes his ability to grant mastery of a given subject just beyond the normal limits of theory and knowledge, using several people working in tandem to achieve low-quality Tinker products.

Teacher is able to give a wide variety of mental powers, including:

## Named Thralls
## Other Abilities
Teacher is a highly educated man, having used his powers to create his own tutors. Teacher is learned in history, foreign affairs, management, and internal affairs, intelligence, code-breaking, medicine and poisons, parahuman studies, accounting and trade, the sciences, the arts and strategy and tactics in military, government and business settings. In addition, he has learned from those who he called 'public speakers, flirts, con artists, actors, thieves, magicians, and cutthroats'.

## Shard
Behind the scenes, his shard sets up a temporary network of thinker/tinker shards for his thralls so that those with granted powers are a part of the shard network.
