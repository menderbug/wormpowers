# Ballistic
Luke is one of the offensive powerhouses of the Travelers â€” he has the ability to imbue any inorganic object he touches, from ball bearings to automobiles, with kinetic energy, causing it to go flying at a bullet-like speed in a direction of his choice, faster than sound.

He does not have to limit himself to small objects, as he can apply the effect to people's clothes and to large objects like cars. Like most of the Travelers he had to be highly restrained and selective with his power to make sure he didn't hurt people.
