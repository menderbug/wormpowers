# Engel
Engel has a permanent master-aura, that forces anybody perceiving her into intense pleasurable synesthesia and somewhat infatuated state. This can be an issue for people who have traumas related to these feelings. It partially affects technology, and can be transferred through cameras in weakened form.

Engel also has a unique vision, that reveals things in the darkness but limits her ability to see things in light.
