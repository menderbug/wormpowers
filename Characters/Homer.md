# Homer
Homer has a deadly accuracy power, that allowed him to hit a baseball into angles that would inevitably hit somebody's weak point, like their temple or heart. He is not able to find non-lethal application of it.

Homer has the ability to make things ricochet on contact with a surface, with the post-ricochet being even stronger.

## Equipment
Homer carried a golden baseball bat, and a baseball with black skin and gold stitches.
