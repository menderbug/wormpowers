# Behemoth
Besides the regeneration and incredible durability associated with his Endbringer physiology that lets him fight as a skeleton despite tanking a blast that would have destroyed India and losing around 80% of his body, Behemoth is a destructive engine built to break stasis. Most of his powers are simply variations of his dynakinesis, an all-encompassing ability capable of producing and manipulating all kinds of energy. What makes this ability even more dangerous is his lack of a Manton limitation within a radius of 32 feet, meaning he can affect living matter as easily as any other material. The most common expressions of this are:

## Lightning
One of Behemoth's most iconic and feared abilities is his ability to generate and guide lightning. If he has line of sight, Behemoth can launch lightning, typically from the tip of his claws, to strike targets over long distances. He can also strike across a distance and set indiscriminate fires with his lightning. By redirecting the natural course of electricity, he can cut a Dragon-craft in half in only five hits despite the insulation. If Behemoth focuses, he can either concentrate on quantity such as a storm of lightning centered around himself, or really heavy hits such as:

Behemoth can guide his bolts to hit pinpoint targets or a group of targets. His lightning can defy the normal laws of conduction and arc out of metal objects when normally they'd ground out. Although Behemoth's lightning does not appear to follow regular channels, it is possible to redirect his lightning by creating a path of least resistance and/or ionizing the air.

## Kill Aura
Behemoth can bypass the Manton effect and manifest energy within anyone who ventures within a 32-foot radius of him, burning them from the inside out. He typically produces a 1400Â°C flame inside his targets; however, he can make this flame hotter if he focuses.

The recommended distance from Behemoth is at least 100 feet so that there is less risk of him closing the gap before one can escape. This ability makes anyone without extreme durability or ranged attacks nearly worthless in the fight; capes that cannot engage Behemoth will typically operate as search, rescue, and support.

## Radiation
Another signature ability of Behemoth's is to project radiation around himself. Capes fighting him typically take radiation pills. When Behemoth uses this ability, he glows with white light. His ability to emit concentrated radiation is limited to a radius of around 100 feet, which is enough to saturate the area with radiation and inflict acute radiation syndrome.

As a last resort and if not stopped, Behemoth can turn himself into a bomb with enough time.

## Shockwaves
Behemoth can produce shockwaves, often in quick succession, by clapping his hands or claws together. These shockwaves can be powerful enough to knock over nearby buildings and liquefy people in close proximity. The concussive shock can even travel far enough sometimes to be weakly felt halfway across a city. However, enough cover and/or distance can mitigate the effects of the shockwave.

Behemoth can use a shockwave when leaping to cover short distances. He can also use shockwaves to help spread the radiation he produces.

Behemoth can deliver massive impacts by slamming an appendage against targets. The resulting shockwave can be powerful enough to level a whole row of buildings. If given enough time underground, he can possibly use shockwaves in key areas to set up fissures and shatter the above landscape.

## Roar
By manipulating sonic energy, Behemoth can unleash a roar that grows steadily more powerful. The force of the noise is so powerful at its crescendo that with enough time, he can topple nearby buildings. To people close by, Behemoth's roar can obliterate eyeballs, rupture eardrums, induce vomiting and fainting, and turn organs into jelly with enough time. 
Even with some distance and cover, his roar can mess with the sense of balance and cause buildings to shudder. However, it is possible to block or suppress this noise. Enough distance and/or cover can stop the sound from reaching someone.

## Fire and Heat
Behemoth can turn any target who comes within a 200-foot radius of him into cinders by unleashing a wave or stream of flame from his hands. He can use dynakinesis to fuel flames, make them more intense, and manipulate their spread in an intelligent manner. However, it is possible to catch and redirect his flame with enough opposing pyrokinetics.

To strike targets at a distance, Behemoth can superheat debris into lumps of magma to hurl as projectiles. He can also create waves of heated wind capable of blasting small drones out of the air.

Behemoth can generate explosions in mid-air to redirect falls and build momentum for movement. If given enough time, he can also manipulate nearby volcanos.

## Energy Redirection
Although Behemoth prefers to focus on offense and can tank many attacks thrown at him, he can compound his natural durability by absorbing and redirecting the energy from a given attack. He can redirect the energy of an attack into the ground around him or into the air. He also notably redirected the energy from Pretender's charge into his Alexandria body. However, Behemoth has to be ready and know when an attack is coming. If he is distracted or his focus is elsewhere, his ability to redirect the energy from a given attack is reduced.

## Other Abilities
Even with an empty eye socket, Behemoth is not blind because he relies on another sense. Like other Endbringers, Behemoth cannot be predicted easily with the typical Thinker danger sense and is also a blind spot to the typical precognition, including Contessa.

Behemoth can generate electromagnetic waves capable of wiping out electronics. He can even wipe out some reinforced electronics if he is close enough.

While Behemoth typically walks, he is capable of running to an extent. He can also burrow to move underground and set up ambushes or retreat.
