# Fog
Turns into living fog that causes harm to those within.
Schmidt has the ability to shift as much or as little of his body as he wishes into a gaseous entity, with varying solidity dependent on his whim. He has the separate ability to erode living matter that is in his radius while in this form. Can deliver horrific internal damage should a subject inhale the mist that comprises his other form.

The only available case study for the effects of inhaling 'him' is the animal Angelica, who never recovered from the damage that inhaling the cloud form of Fog did to her. Even two years later the animal is unable to move well despite the regenerative effects of Hellhound's powers. It can be presumed that any human inhaling parts of him would be exposed to similar amounts of damage.

## Power Classifications
Night and Fog's PRT classifications are given in Sentinel 9.1 as "a Breaker 9" and "a Shifter 8 with Stranger 3", but it is unclear in the chapter which rating refers to which character. Later comments by the author have indicated that Fog is the Breaker, and that he has since changed his mind and would now consider Night the Breaker and Fog either a Breaker or Changer.
