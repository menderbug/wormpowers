# Clockblocker
Clockblocker could "tag" nearly anything, freezing it in time. This power could affect living creatures, including humans, as well as inanimate objects. It could not affect him.

Targets were stuck in the air, immobile, but weren't harmed. They were immune to conventional attacks. He described the effect as being "inviolable", according to "the doctors", and claimed that he would sooner expect Siberian to "fold the universe in half" than break something he froze. Thin objects could be extremely sharp, threatening enemies who moved into them.

Clockblocker could freeze something within a fraction of a second of it making contact, whether it be his hands, feet, or any part of his body. He could freeze only the bugs that were in contact with a section of his body, or everything in contact with him at once. He was able to tag Leviathan without being injured, though it did cause him to almost drown in the water he was in.

Clockblocker couldn't disable the effects of his power. Objects remained frozen for a period between 30 seconds and 10 minutes, with no control over the time limit. His powers remained comparatively static throughout the storyline.

His power worked through interconnected objects, but it had a limited range. Like many parahumans, his power's strength varied based on his mental state. He was just barely able to push it through the thread binding Echidna and Ignis Fatuus, noting that his power must have been "working at peak efficiency" at the time.
