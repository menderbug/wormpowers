# Felix Swoop
Felix is classified as a Master/Blaster hybrid, with the ability to control certain birds or 'familiars' and apply fire resistance and pyrokinesis to them, turning each of them into a 'Phoenix'. Larger birds are even more resistant to fire and explosions when granted his power.

While he has been compared to fellow Masters like Weaver and Aidan, his command is far more limited than what they have. He does not have complete control of his minions like they do, nor does he seem to have the ability to tap into the their sensorium; perceiving the world through his birds senses. He is closer to Bitch in that he needs to train his pets, though he is able to control the creatures with 'programmed' paths.

## Equipment
Needs to keep his avian minions housed and feed when he is not using them.
