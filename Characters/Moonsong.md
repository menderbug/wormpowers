# Moonsong
Moonsong is a gravity manipulator who can create multiple conflicting gravity fields within an area. Seemingly able to manipulate overlapping gravity environments to throw people around.

Brianna has a thinker-aspect, that allows her to perceive gravity wells.

Effects produced by her break if she loses concentration, for example, has to move with care. She can apply the power to herself while moving to make it near-silent, moving purely with her power, however, strains her attention significantly.

She is acknowledged as competent even by people who do not like her.

After The Firmament bombing her power is more rigid.
