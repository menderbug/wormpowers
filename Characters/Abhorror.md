# Abhorror
One Abhorror usedÂ globular clusters of darkness that he could control in mid-air through a small link of shadow between his hand and the sphere. They stuck to targets like gum and allowed the Abhorror to absorb the captured target's powers.

Another Abhorror is capable of teleporting himself and others through his darkness. The range of his darkness is large and spanned across city blocks. This darkness is thin and is described as "sloshing" around.
