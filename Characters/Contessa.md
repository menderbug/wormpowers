# Contessa
Contessa's power allows her to see the adaptable steps she needs to take to succeed at nearly any given task and execute them perfectly. Its applications include combat, communication, social situations, Cauldron's long-term plans, and how to set conditions for trigger events. Through a series of questions (see below) she is able to use it to the utmost. Though almost unparalleled in power even it has limits or restrictions. (see below)

She can default to following the path, letting her Shard take over. Thus putting herself out of range for many powers.

When trying to persuade someone it gives her the savoir faire necessary to succeed.

Her power does not allow her to Tinker rather it gives her the ability to handle tinkertech while avoiding misfires and lets her damage or subvert it just enough for it to do what she wants.

As Path to Victory is All-or-Nothing, the typical precognitive cannot interfere with her power. Contessa is also a blind spot for precognitives (e.g, Shamrock, Dinah, the Simurgh). She cannot be predicted easily with the typical Thinker danger sense: Goddess could only feel a directionless threat and inevitable doom when Contessa sent her to Earth Shin.

## Questions
To get the most out of her power she asks herself various questions at the start of each day, and various questions before a mission to ensure success. This lets her keep to the path to defeat Zion and provides her with protection against masters and strangers.

Her power also provides her with excellent information gathering abilities provided the right questions are asked.

## Vulnerabilities
Contessa still needs food, rest, and sleep, or she would have to lean on her power for more minute details, making it harder for her to run background processes and long simulations. More specifically, if she did not take care of herself and became physically weaker, her power would break things down into a series of derivative steps to be more precise about minute details that contribute to a specific end result. When fatigued, Contessa needs to devote more resources to staying on task; Cauldron collected people from multiple worlds instead of one world to draw less notice and reduce the labor for her.

Contessa's power does not protect her against human error as it is theoretically possible to trick her into asking the wrong question. However, given time, she asks questions beforehand about deception, mind control, area of effect, and other obstacles her power wouldn't effectively fight against; this significantly reduces the likelihood of being tricked. She also asks questions to protect her against Strangers, Masters, Thinkers, and attacks against all corners. That said, if Contessa does not take care of herself and gets worn down enough, there is a risk that she forgets to ask these questions or falls ill. She could also ask the wrong questions or hear the wrong things, where 'wrong' is something that takes her off of the course she was on and is a relative wrong, not a moral wrong.

Without outside interference, Jack Slash's secondary power prevents her from killing him.

## Blind Spots
Just before Eden's ultimate defeat, she restricted Contessa's power to prevent it from showing Contessa the Entities' deepest secrets. Thus, Contessa has blind spots that she cannot directly use her power on: the Entities themselves, the Endbringers, Eidolon, and shardspace. Trigger events are also a blind spot; she cannot predict their outcomes.

As of the Attack on Teacher, she also has Teacher, Valkyrie, and two broken triggers as blind spots. Note that Contessa directly pathed Teacher and Glaistig Uaine in the past. At some point, they presumably turned into blind spots when their behind-the-scenes network in shardspace became sufficiently complex. For example, Teacher was no longer a blind spot after Victoria Dallon reset his thrall network in shardspace.

She can still somewhat predict the actions of blind spots by considering a hypothetical situation.

Shard-derived sensory powers cannot perceive Mantellum (i.e., he blinds shards); he and anyone in his radius are a blind spot. Contessa herself is also a blind spot to her power.

Contessa's power does not range well beyond Earth, so flying into space and bombarding the planet would do fine against her. Her power is probably unable to account for metaphysical stuff outside of the shard's realm of expertise.

## Titan Fortuna
Upon her becoming Titan Fortuna, her power changes to quickly being able to create and envision thousands of possible futures, along with the steps needed to achieve them, within seconds for any single goal she requests. She can read the details of all of them when she wills, in order to see the other details of the futures where her goal is fulfilled so to choose which one is the most favourable, then select one future Path to work towards. If both the Titan and the human Host use the power in-tandem and work together, they can concoct possible future Paths even quicker than normal.

However, the future Paths she comes up with are not every possible future, merely the ones her power's processing ability has calculated. As such, what Paths there are is dependant on this calculating ability, such as how long is spent on coming up with futures for a single goal and the aid that the Host can supply in thinking power and processing ability.

As a Titan, Fortuna only has her host, Contessa, as a blind spot. For example, she can directly path Endbringers such as the Simurgh. However, Fortuna still needs time to spread her range of influence; despite being vastly more powerful than the Simurgh, Fortuna was initially on the backfoot during their precog duel because she just became a Titan and was starting from scratch. In comparison, the Simurgh spent two years preparing for her fight against the Titan and was already close to achieving her goals.

Several interdimensional cracks manifested around the Titan after the ice broke. Fortuna would use these cracks in her paths; however, as these cracks opened to shardspace, a nearby Simurgh could now potentially interfere with the information Fortuna was trying to transmit to her network. More specifically, the Simurgh's signal over time could "tamper" with paths being investigated by the Titan so that they appear to be in the Endbringer's favor. That said, once Fortuna asked her host for help and worked in concert to quickly execute a path without investigating it too much, the Simurgh could not tamper with it, forcing the Endbringer to leave.

## Shard
Originally derived from Abaddon after he gave it to Eden, Contessa's power is the result of collecting the Eye after Eden crash landed onto an Earth. The Entities use the Eye as a defense mechanism to protect themselves from outside threats and problems. Because Eden did not willingly hand out this shard, it was not originally given the weaknesses that prevent it from interfering with the Entities and the Cycle. Thus, the Eye was helpless to stop Contessa from using it against Eden.

Like Contessa, the Eye also has issues with needing direction. The shard only started a plan to form a complete shard network and then end the Cycle early (i.e., scatter resulting offspring to other planets) after Contessa became a Titan.

According to Scion, Contessa's shard is not dead. Indeed, the Eye is alive and still somewhat connected to Abaddon even after Gold Morning, presumably because Eden was in the process of integrating the shard before she crash-landed and lost it.
