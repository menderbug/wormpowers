# Mockument
Mockument has a Master ability that allows him to create homunculus copies, caricature or mockeries, of parahumans. These are twisted caricatures, versions of capes that represent everything the target hates about themselves, thus copying Antares makes a horrid puddle of flesh while copying Sidepiece makes a (comparatively) slightly distorted version, While his own creates what may be a shade of the original. These clones also gain the abilities of the original cape, but in no way near as potent or reliable, he can have several active at a time.

The Thinker rating seemingly comes from the clones knowledge of their target, and what Mockument can learn from observing their behavior. The homunculi don't seem to be able to exist for very long.
