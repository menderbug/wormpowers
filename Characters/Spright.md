# Spright
Spright is a Trump who copies powers.

His power lets him sense Mover-type aspects of nearby parahuman powers and mimic certain aspects of the powers of nearby parahumans for himself. He can seemingly choose to only mimic one ability of a parahuman with multiple powers if requested. The powers last for a short time after he leaves the parahuman's vicinity before fading.

This includes letting him copy the breaker state of a speedster, blaster attacks with recoil, changer transformations, flight, and even some of the physical alterations of Case 53s. His power is particularly effective when copying changers, lasting for longer and giving him access to more of the offensive aspect of the power than most.

His copying does not seems to provide him a full intuition about power, since he is struggling with his teammates high-skill power and is noticeably relieved when he met a stranger with simpler power.

His baseline powers, powers he has when there are no other parahumans around to mirror, are unknown if they are present at all. He is trained in flexibility and urban movement based on the skills showcased.
