# Trickster
Francis' power enables him to swap the locations of two objects with similar mass, including himself. 

Trickster’s powers only work on targets that are both within his field of view. His speed/ease of being able to swap is dependent on distance (although not as much as one might suspect) and difference in mass – too much of one or the other and it’s not doable in any reasonable amount of time. He needs to even out any differences in mass by sucking in surrounding air, which takes time. He can use his powers to feel the weight of an object he is observing, and he has a sense of how easy it would be to swap two targets at a time.
