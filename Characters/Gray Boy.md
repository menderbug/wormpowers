# Gray Boy
Gray Boy is able to form stationary time loops, and his power reverts any changes made to his body. A quirk of his power is that anything affected is heavily desaturated, giving him his namesake monochrome look. 

Gray Boy is the only one who could enter the loops. During these loops, the only changes to the victim to carry over are those he inflicts on them (such as a cut or burn) and in the progression of their thoughts. Pain inflicted on the victims is repeated over and over again. Gray Boy can modify the time between loops, extending them to give victims time to speak full words or shortening them to more quickly repeat the initial burst of pain from a wound. However, he claimed to be unable to turn it off for anyone except himself. The powers of anyone trapped inside them were unable to reach out of the loop.

He claimed that victims would usually go insane after a few days, then work through that back to sanity, then crack again, in an endless cycle. He also claimed that they never grew used to the pain he inflicted.

According to Gray Boy's sources, a time loop that he creates will last until well after the sun goes out. However, in truth it only lasts for around ten thousand years or so.

Gray Boy can affect an area roughly 5 feet across and 8 feet high, and is able to freeze a ten-foot-high "wall" of air on one occasion. He claimed his power operated at the "speed of thought," and that he believed no one is immune to it. His power can obliquely act on objects charged by Foil, allowing him to effectively freeze her darts in midair if he notices their approach.

His power also makes him effectively immortal, constantly restoring his body to the exact condition it is in when he first got his powers. This prevented him from aging or even getting dirty. He retained memories despite his constant reversion. Any time he is hurt or debilitated, his power would take him back as far as he needed, allowing him to maintain his position if he wanted or move out of the way.

Gray Boy knew Bonesaw's name before she told him, and she believed he - like Jack - is aware she planned to betray the Nine. It is unclear what aspect of his powers allowed this. He has no special ability to aim his attacks, and didn't receive feedback from his power regarding what he'd hit.

## Vulnerabilities
If Gray Boy dies while his power is effectively nullified (e.g., his connection to his shard is disrupted), he will be permanently killed. For example, Glaistig Uaine killed the original by claiming him as a shadow (i.e., co-opting his power behind-the-scenes) at the same time of his death. A headshot by Foil's charged darts killed the clone by killing him at the same time as his shard connection being disrupted by the effects of her power.

King's power can obliquely redirect Gray Boy's time loops away from him to other touched individuals. Wildbow speculates that someone capable of disrupting their connection to reality, with weird relation to time, could theoretically escape a time loop.

Without outside interference, Jack Slash's secondary power prevents Gray Boy from looping him.

## Breaking a Time Loop
A tuned Stilling attack, such as one from Scion, can break a time loop. Jeanne Wynn is confident she could do the same, though she is not willing to do so after the risk assessment she and the Wardens did. March outside of a time loop can break it, presumably with the help of specialized tinkertech that is used on a Bakuda-derived time bubble.

Gray Boy's victims are repeatedly trying to trigger; however, the shards are unable to establish a connection to those trapped inside despite their best efforts. Because trigger events are a blind spot for the typical precognitive, they cannot see the consequences of breaking a time loop with people inside. What little they could indirectly see afterward looked "bad" to them.

After much research, the Wardens initially believed it is too risky to free his victims, especially once they learned that freed victims would typically have a broken trigger after Scion's death. For example, when March broke a time loop containing the mayor of Killington, he became an S-Class problem that involved giant worms. However, after the Titans crumbled, the Wardens began efforts to let people out. Still wary of broken triggers, they made sure to communicate with those they intended to keep alive in order to prepare them.

Although Titan Fortuna fixed the shard network so that broken triggers are on a sharp decline, freed individuals would trigger or second trigger as the shards are still trying to establish a connection. According to Five, breaking a time loop creates a 94.1% chance that any person inside will trigger or second trigger the instant they are released. However, it is possible to prevent an individual from triggering by immediately stabbing the released individual in a specific part of the brain, or collapsing the time loop such that it kills the individual in the process.

## Shard
According to Scion, Gray Boy's shard creates legitimate sinkholes of distorted time. Note that temporal powers are expensive for the Entities to use, and are thus extremely limited for them. Although Gray Boy's shard can create a time distortion effect that spans a few seconds between loops and affects everything in its localized area by holding them in a kind of drastic superposition, extending the time between loops to say a minute or a day is effectively not possible due to its sheer cost.
