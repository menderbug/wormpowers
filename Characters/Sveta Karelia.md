# Sveta Karelia


Her control of this body slowly increased over the years. She gained a lot of control quickly. thanks to the help of her teammate Precipice. There needed to be regular sessions to ensure that her control didn't waver. 

## Instinct
From the outset Sveta is incapable of fully controlling the strength of her tendrils which leads her to instinctively crush any stressor with them. This also means her power is reactive to any threat against her no matter the source.  Her powers' behavior may stem from Sveta having little initial connection with her Shard. Functioning largely independent of her' making computer use hard but not impossible with the right equipment.

Her body has its own mind that she could not always override. This included an instinctual hunter behavior that made her body conceal itself before people entered her room in the asylum. This instinct is likely responsible for her high kill count. Similarly her body ensures she is healthy and not close to death and will make her eat food, regardless of quality if it senses her close to starving.

## Durability
Her tentacles have notable durability, stated to be one of the reasons she is captured instead of killed when she is first found by the outside authorities. Being essentially bullet proof given her tentacles and her incredibly small vital area.  It is strong enough to withstand devastating blasts though not unscathed. Luckily her body is still a living organism, as such it can recover and regrow large sections of it self.

Also as a living organism Sveta still regularly showers.

## Strength and Speed
A single large tendril can easily rip a limb off of someone, several at once possess enough strength to bend steel bars and demolish concrete barriers. Further these can move at speeds normal eyes can not track.

When she couldn't control herself the only way for a normal human to safely interact with her would be to wear what is essentially a deep sea scuba divers suit - walking tank, one that needs regular maintenance between visits. She is even able to affect Weld thanks to her strength.

She is able to fling a massive load with her tentacles with enough leverage, even though she is injured at the time.




In her full body Prosthesis (see above) she retains her durability, but is restrained somewhat by the confines of the humanoid body. She moves somewhat clumsily. This is due counter-intuitive movement that is required to control bodysuit from the inside. Nervousness has been known to exacerbate this problem.

She can unlatch her joints, allowing her to extend her limbs a considerable distance, as she can when she is completely out of the body, and use them as grappling hooks. She is able to remove part of the prosthesis to allow out more appendages.. Her body is, however, not smart enough to get out of the suit without her conscious input,, including above the "neck", where tendrils are loosely restrained with a series of metal rings. She usually needs assistance to get out of the suit.

For example, she is confident in her ability to use her arms to snatch Kenzie out of Ashley's way. Even with her grip strength being less than adequate and Ashley being able to move faster then her. She uses her ability to move around quickly but not always gracefully. 

## Skill
Despite all these challenges Sveta has showcased a talent for art. When she received her mechanical body she made a habit of decorating its outside with painting.

Notably, she is able to use the multitude of her appendages to draw simultaneously in different areas, drastically cutting down on time to make her creations.

Ashley showed Sveta how to use her tentacles to open yale locks.




After having her body transformed by Mr. Bough, Sveta's ability took more of a Changer form, in which she could unwrap her body into thicker, flatter tendrils with serrated edges. These serrated edges are capable of cutting people.

She demonstrated ability to hide objects inside her body, including her armored costume.
