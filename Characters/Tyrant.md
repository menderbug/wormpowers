# Tyrant
Tyrant has the powers of both King and Hatchet Face, although somewhat diluted. He has King's ability to transfer physical harm done to himself to anyone he has touched within a certain time period, though it's unknown exactly how long compared to the original. He also has Hatchet Face's power nullifying aura, though his range is shorter and took proximity to fully kick in. From both capes, he inherited enhanced strength and durability.

The conjunction of Tyrant's powers made him a terrifying opponent, able to completely ignore physical damage and nullify nearby parahumans that could potentially bypass that defense.
