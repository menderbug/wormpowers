# Seir
Seir's ability is two-fold. First, he noisily blasts out shadowy lines, where these strands land, on any surface, silhouettes made of shadow appear. The connective lines count as living tissue for some powers under the Manton Effect. As long as clones are created, and there can be as many as twelve, possibly more, Seir is able to swap places with the clones. Further, these clones can act independently of Seir, presumably following his directions and general intent. The clones and lines can be affected by powers (such as forcefields, Tinker guns, and an unspecified Blaster power) but not by (at least) tasers as they presumably lack a body to conduct the electricity. When hit the shadowy energy tends to dissipate but it's not clear how durable they are/how hard they have to be hit to do so.
