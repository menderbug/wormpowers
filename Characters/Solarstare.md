# Solarstare
Solarstare is a blaster with a three-beat attack that emanates from her eyes. The first beat is a massive stream of liquid that resembles molten golden or magma, that travels fast enough to deliver serious damage by itself. This column is about five feet around. The second beat is when the matter ignites into white flames, with temperatures high enough to instantly turn surroundings into glass. The final stage transforms the flames into ultra-bright sparks, that can blind for up to 2 minutes.
