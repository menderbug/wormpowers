# Chitter
One Chitter has the ability to control "rodents," in this case rats, which is a variant on Taylor's ability to control bugs. It is unknown if she could control other species of rodents or is limited to only rats.

Several other clones of Taylor Hebert were created that shared her ability to control bugs. Similar to the effects of the Famine Engine, the clones' use of their abilities interfered with Taylor's ability to direct her bugs, overriding Taylor's commands and taking total control of her swarm. Additionally, they could control Echidna produced insects, something Taylor couldn't do.
