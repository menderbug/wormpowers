Olivia's power lets her animate discrete objects, be they mechanical devices like a garage door or several large vehicles. She is able to make them function without electrical power, driving them purely by telekinesis. Offensively she can reconfigure her targets into other shapes that can then move on their own; she is only seen using roughly humanoid minions but other shapes are possible if joints are physically present. She needs to be able to physically touch an object however - afterward she is able to direct them as she sees fit. She is not limited in the number of creations she can make or how far away they can move from her, only by how far she can see and sense them.

Weaver compares Romp's abilities to Bitch, but her power is closer to Parian's in execution. She has a higher power threat then Bitch or Parian. But where as Bitch's dogs are independent, if trained animals, Olive creates "loose, telekinetically animated servants" out of available mechanical material that are restricted to her immediate presence and her own grasp of tactics. Further Olive's creations need her continuous influence to remain animated; if her power is canceled out her creations collapse, whereas Bitch's can function independently for a length of time outside her influence.

## Restrictions
As discussed previously Olivia's only true constraints are the time she has to create an object. Her power adapts objects into servitors for her regardless of material but prefabricated materials will generally work best.

Animating and converting structures like a bridge or a concrete block or any other single piece construction lengthens the time to the point of in-feasibility with the materials coming apart. This includes buildings and such.

Her creations are incapable of flying, probably. Assuming there isn't a dedicated flying mechanical contraption she could conceivably co-opt.
