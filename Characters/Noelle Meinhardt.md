# Noelle Meinhardt
Noelle has the ability to consume people and make clones out of them. If someone touches her, clones of that person will emerge that are stronger, of a twisted disposition, and loyal only to Noelle herself but otherwise impossible to control. If she maintains contact with the original, she can continuously produce clones of that person. These clones, along with vomit, are her only excretions; she eats only meat and it adds directly to her mass. She is capable of manipulating the created limbs of this mass to devastating effect.

Any clone created from a parahuman gives the clone parahuman a variation of the original's abilities. This is done through a process similar to budding.

All the above powers are fueled through a seemingly bottomless resource of potential mass stored in the core of her lower half; this also allows her to grow and regenerate at an alarming rate.

It is likely that her power is affected by the fact that she is administered only half a dose of Cauldron's superpower serum; her unstable temperament and monstrous lower body were probably not in the intended spectrum of effects. Oliver, who drank the second half of the dose, may have received the portion of the power intended to moderate and control these effects.
