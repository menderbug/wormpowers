# Abaddon
Abaddon traveled using a different means to the Thinker and the Warrior, mainly through propulsion rather than the spatial warping that the othersÂ did.

Its divergent evolution is such that communication is initially difficult between itself and the Thinker entity. The creatures have almost incalculable processing power.

Thanks to Abaddon's contribution Eden is able to understand concepts more intricate than simple conflict.
