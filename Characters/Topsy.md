Daniel has the power to alter the direction but not magnitude of gravitational pull on or by himself, other people, and objects within his range. He applies his powers most offensively by hurling people or objects up and then reversing his power to let them fall.

This environmental change allows him to do things like walk along the sides of buildings. Daniel is not strictly limited to shifting gravity ninety or even a hundred eighty degrees but every degree in between. It is unknown how controlled he can be with the effect or how localized it can be. He can only seem to manifest one gravitational change at a time.

This power lets him weaponize loose objects. Being able to reverse gravity up sending them up into the air and then refocus gravity to send it towards his targets. He can also use it to move large amnounts of objects around. Securing oneself to the ground as well as other objects negates much of his offensive ability. His power has an upper limit, when objects reach the treashold of his effect the object will be effectively weightless in the liminality of the effect and regular gravity.
