# Scape
The Scapes all has powers similar to Vista, with some variations. One masked Scape has the ability to twist the world around her, using it to weaken walls and building supports. Her power worked differently from Vista's, affecting a wider area but at a slower speed. Her power is also not hindered by the presence of people. She could sense the world through her power, able to stretch buildings even with her eyes obstructed.

Another masked Scape could twist space around her into jagged shapes, with some of them raised into points.

The tall Scape could warp and twist matter, corkscrewing it until it is nothing but dust. Everything she dissolved turned into radioactive dust.

Yet another Scape is able to hide people in two-dimensional space. Upon emerging from a surface, they would peel away and emerge unscathed. People in two-dimensional space could still be injured if the surface they resided on is damaged.

A Scape with fingernail-like plates of flesh is able to raise surfaces and sculpt them into rough images. She used this to raise statues of Echidna from the pavement as decoys to distract Eidolon.
