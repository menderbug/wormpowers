# Alabaster
## Primary Ability
At set intervals of 4.3 seconds, Alabaster reverts to a base template i.e., restores himself to a pristine condition. This restoration not only heals him of any physical damage, wounds, and mutations, but also of any ongoing physical, mental, or emotional effects.

He is a rare example of a natural trigger whose ability physically mutates him.

## Other Abilities
Alabaster is immune to pain; he can mutilate himself without issue.

He also has a minor Thinker power that makes him more effective at maintaining and fixing equipment. This gives him more knowledge in repairing and craftsmanship, which complements his ability to stay in the fight (i.e., he would be less combat-effective if he did not know how to fix his broken gear).

## Vulnerabilities
If his body received enough punishment to destroy him, if his corona faced complete destruction, or if his heart was torn out right as the loop began (which would shock the Corona Pollentia), his powers would be disrupted, and he would perish.

His power does not change his position when reverting his state. For example, his power did not free him from a Bakuda-derived time bubble: Dauntless speculated that the trapped Alabaster might be in the circumstance of only being able to think.

Scapegoat's power will either misfire or backfire if he theoretically attempts to transfer injuries to Alabaster. To elaborate, either Alabaster gets injuries that carry over through loops (i.e., becomes part of Alabaster's base template) or the injuries bounce back to Scapegoat with a vengeance.

## Equipment
He carries two pistols, a concealed stiletto knife, and ammo clips.

## Tactics
On seeing him in action, Taylor speculates that his standard operating procedure is to fight on the front line and act as a delaying tactic. His power enables him to occupy opponents as a relatively minor if persistent threat, while having a chance to take out problem targets. This buys time for the rest of his team to pursue their own targets.
