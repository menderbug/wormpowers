# Flechette
## Primary Ability
Lily has the ability to temporarily imbue nonliving material with the power to ignore select laws of physics. Most notably, they could punch through virtually anything. It is able to go through any defence and materialise inside of a target, fusing to it, and can ignore various forms of conventional superhuman durability as if the opposition is like "warm-butter". She is not restricted to her hand when she uses this power. When imbuing an object with her power, Lily could tune the effect; for example, she could alter the time limit so that her charged ammunition would glue itself to a place (at the molecular level) if she timed the effect to wear off at the right time. She could use her ability on her costume to reduce the effects of friction or make her shoes bite into surfaces. Another trick she could do is to make her costume frictionless and allow her to slide around.

Scion described her power as "charging objects with energy [...] the small pieces of alloyed metal unfolded, taking shape in not just this world, but all realities, at the same space and time, bristling with an effect that would sever their attachment to most physical laws." Said power can unerringly reach into every dimension, including the one the target is in. Although this is widely interpreted to mean that they extend into every Alternate Earth and hit things that are present in one Earth but not in another, this may not be the case.

Using her power on Chevalier's sword would have broken it.

Lily's charged shots can pierce right through an Endbringer, as demonstrated against Leviathan and Behemoth. She can kill one with a direct hit to their core. After discovering the full ramifications of her power during the Battle against Behemoth, the Endbringers changed their methodology to better avoid situations where Lily could set up a killing blow.

## Other Abilities
Lily has an intuitive understanding of angles, trajectories and an enhanced sense of timing that she uses for aiming and applying her power. It also gave her a defensive advantage being able to dodge blows easily and even catch arrows out of the air.

## Vulnerabilities
Although her All-or-Nothing attacks can pierce through any non-perfect defense, objects charged by her power are not inviolable. On separate occasions, both Tecton and Ballistic launched objects charged by Lily. Scion touched the flat side of a razor blade charged by her with a tuned Stilling attack to disintegrate it. Powers such as those from Trickster and Gray Boy can obliquely act on objects charged by Lily and redirect them before they make contact. Vista's power can also obliquely warp objects charged by Lily's primary shard.

If a charged object contacts an All-or-Nothing effect, they will nullify each other, causing the object to lose its charge:

She is unable to escape a Gray Boy time loop. However, as March broke an entire time loop from the outside at Killington, Lily can presumably do the same with the help of specialized tinkertech.

Lily believed that trying to use her power to intuitively understand angles on Vista's space warping might give her a seizure. The Number Man can counter her enhanced accuracy via his Thinker power to dodge her shots.

## Shards
The three shards in her cluster call themselves the three faces. The Entities refer to Lily's primary shard as "Sting". It is originally used for fighting other Entities.

Sting does not have much need to evolve: the Entities have not discovered a way to really improve or vary it. However, handing this power out to hosts can give the Entities the opportunity to figure things out at the end of the cycle by seeing how other powers interact with it. Giving away this power is standard procedure for Scion and Eden as they have contingencies in place to automatically dodge charged projectiles.
