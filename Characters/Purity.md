# Purity
Kayden falls into the category of 'flying artillery' capes. She has the ability to create kinetically charged light, to move through the air at high speeds while generating powerful blasts.Â She moved too fast for anyone among the Brockton Bay heroes but Dauntless or Velocity to catch, and she hit harder than both of them combined. Her power left firefly-like motes of light behind it when used.

She could create two curved beams emanating from one hand, creating an expanding double-helix shape that is wider than she is and capable of leveling buildings. She could also create smaller beams, or fire multiple beams at once. Her beams were almost as powerful as Legend's, although not as versatile. It took her a moment to "charge" her beams, energy visibly welling up in her hands.

She has an internal supply of energy, which recharged when she basked under special halogen lights in Kaiser's office. Jack Slash noticed that, after periods where there is more sunlight, her powers were stronger, which may suggest that sunlight gives her more power than regular light.
