# Aisha Laborn
## Primary Ability
Aisha's power renders her unnoticeable to the point where the people around forget she was even there in the first place. When explaining why she let Regent have control over her, she said that Regent's control over her would break once he slept and her ability kicked in. As a downside to this ability, she has to consciously make herself visible to others, her power is always on otherwise. Unlike her brother she could still be found by scent but when her power is 'on' it is incredibly difficult to link that scent to her.

In her interlude, there appears to be another level to her ability. She describes a growing power that disappears whenever she notices it, causing it to never manifest. She has no idea what would happen if it did.

Later development of her power has allowed verbal communication without having to reveal herself. While active, her power effectively made her immune to Khepri. She could use her power with fine control to only erase the last few moments of a conversation, repeating this until she found the right line to use.

Purportedly records of her do decay over time, including Tinker equipment.

## Vulnerabilities
Her power has a 50/50 chance of shorting out for a brief time when she attacks someone, which makes it possible to dodge her attack and/or retaliate. It is also possible for people affected by her power to think about her in the abstract sense. For example, when the Undersiders attacked the PRT ENE Headquarters, Flechette recognized that they had a stranger after Imp freed Grue and Regent from their cuffs. Tattletale can use her power to work around Imp's power to an extent. At one point, Khepri sensed her bugs shifting positions without moving themselves: Imp revealed herself after Khepri madly swung her knife around. Written signs can obliquely alert others to Imp's presence.

When Aisha had her trigger event, her shard developed a specific interpretation of memory by pulling from the shard network of human knowledge across hosts. Thus, Imp's power only affects memories formed from the standard senses of humans. For example, although Cherish could not see or hear Imp, she could still detect Imp via her emotion sense. Similarly, Love Lost can use her emotion sense to track Imp. Even Valefor was able to see Imp somehow; according to Tattletale, he might have other senses or augmented awareness to track victims.

Individuals such as Dragon, Behemoth, and the Titans are not human and are thus immune to Imp's power. Wildbow speculated that individuals such as Jessie from Twig could also potentially be immune because their memory-handling structure is inherently alien to other humans.

Imp's power does not work against people who view her with video cameras or camera recordings. After Lookout built cameras into her brain, she could always detect and recognize Imp without issue. Othello's mirror self can also see Imp without issue. Contessa can trivially counter Imp by asking questions about strangers.

To reduce Imp's effectiveness, March successfully got the Graeae to swap Imp's arm with Ixnay's arm. While having this arm, she could be more easily tracked because her power did not effectively cover it; for example, Victoria used her aura to help find Imp in a snowfield.

## Other Abilities
Aisha is incredibly perceptive but suffers from untreated ADHD. She could deduce that her brother was Grue, and upon meeting her that Taylor was Skitter. Further she was the only one who noticed the relationship between Taylor's mental state and the actions of the bugs in her powers purview., something that was missed by thinkers like Alexandria and Tattletale.
