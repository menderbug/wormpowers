# Blue Bomber

The Blue Bomber has been recorded in three distinct forms, at least as far as the PRT is aware. His power is to re-actively assume a form based on the interaction with another parahuman's Shard.

The Blue Bomber actually has a Trump power that allows him to assume different forms based on the shard of his opponent. Each confers differing benefits based on the shard. A single base form is available.
