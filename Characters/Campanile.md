# Campanile
Campanile is described as having the ability to grow to enormous heights alongside an aura that alters gravity. Depending on how he can alter his aura, this gives the ability for him to move faster than a being his size should, possibly also allowing him to move things more easily, despite the squareâ€“cube law.
