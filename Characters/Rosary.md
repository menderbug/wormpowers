# Rosary
Rosary has the power to break non-living material into leaf-like fragments, control those fragments, and reconstitute them into the objects or parts of the object at a different location. She is able to use her power to break down a car in three to four seconds.

The flakes she creates are light and fragile enough that they take a while to do much damage, often failing to harm even an insect although they are sharp enough that a storm of petals can cut through spider silk.

One notable offensive use for her power is that she can reconstitute heavy objects in mid-air above her opponents.
