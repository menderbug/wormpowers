# Galvanate
Galvanate can grant a combination of invincibility, enhanced strength, and an electric charge to other individuals with a touch. He can render entire squads effectively invincible, giving them strength powerful enough to qualify the recipient as a Brute, while also making them capable of electrocuting someone to death with a touch. Note that this granted invincibility also stacks with the durability of individuals such as Alexandria and Gavel.

Grue is unable to effectively borrow Galvanate's power with his second trigger darkness.

Galvanate's granted invincibility is not on the same level as Alexandria's durability: it is not strong enough to withstand a sustained blast from Scion for even a heartbeat. Although people expressed hope that his power would make some individuals capable of surviving a glancing blow, it is unknown whether this hypothesis turned out to be true.
