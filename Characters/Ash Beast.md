# Ash Beast
Ash Beast's power is not fully understood, but relies on a conversion between mass and energy to constantly surround himself with some kind of explosion. He seems to possess a regenerative ability and exhibits partially uncontrolled shape-shifting. His explosions are comparable in power to the destructive capabilities of an S-Class threat.

Has a shapeshifting beast form generated through constant matter/energy and energy/matter conversion allowing him to replace and rearrange parts of himself. This kept him far healthier then he should have been. He could absorb fire and presumably other forms of energy to augment his form.

Ash Beast is shown to be capable of matching Scion for an indeterminate period of time. In that fight, he is able to regenerate even as Scion tore into him.

## Drawbacks
According to Tattletale, Ash Beast's power is always on at full capacity. He is one of the earlier examples of a Shard overtaking its host completely where the human experienced a form of ego death. This loss of self gives his Shard more control over his actions, similar to Khepri or Night Hag; his Shard takes advantage of this opportunity to rampage.

Jack Slash's secondary power is better at sabotaging him compared with the typical parahuman.
