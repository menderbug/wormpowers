# Secondhand
Secondhand is a time-stop speedster whose power puts him in a time-dilation state, where the world appears to freeze. It takes some time to activate and deactivate his power. His power effects extend around quarter-inch from his body, converting surrounding elements to his speedster-state and enabling some breathing.

While his power is active, his ability to physically interact with the world is severely limited, even air is experienced as dense as water, and heat is insufferable without protection, which all can lead to injuries. Carried weight also makes it harder to move for him. As a consequence, using his power for extended periods of time leaves him exhausted or even wounded.

He could use his power to scout, patrol large areas, to appear in the midst of a group of enemies, dodging blows, moving to catch a falling ally.

## Equipment
Initially, he used a suit that made him more forceful during his speed-up state, but exacerbated bodily damage.

It is changed to a lightweight tinker-suit that allows him to engage his power for longer and with less risks to his health. It provides him with heat protection, supplies emergency oxygen, as well as batteries that accelerate his state transition or allow to move with more force, and visor overlays, that guide him through challenging airflows.

He also carries remotely detonated explosive charges, similarly lightweight.
