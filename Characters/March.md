# March
March is a Multitrigger cape which gives her several abilities. Her primary power is enhanced timing. March's timing ability allows her to organise groups very efficiently, to the point where she can give the exact amount of time they need to accomplish their tasks and complete a given objective. Further it is a huge help with her own fighting and positioning with which she can pull off seemingly impossible feats. When boosted, time appears to slow for March, allowing her to make decisions on the fly. Her thinker aspect is strong enough to make her unreadable to other Thinkers, such as Tattletale. An added benefit allows her to inject theatricality into everything she does. However it requires her to be knowledgeable about the relevant factors, environment, fitness, parahuman powers, etc. involved so timing can be worked out, otherwise she can be preempted and defeated.

A dangerous secondary ability of hers lets March access a Perfect offensive weapon, while it's a weaker version of her clustermate's power it still lets March cut through nearly any foe's defense.

The other clustermate's gift manifests as a watermark, spreading from its contact point until it detonates upon reaching its apex; a timed explosion. It can interfere with breaker effects and easily kill people just by applying the explosion effect sans any other damage. Related to this is some sort of accuracy power, a major component of Homer's primary ability. It is similarly disrupted by spatial warping as her clustermates is.

She is very good at intuiting connections for Multitriggers, given her past study and possibly personal experiences, such as getting a peek "backstage".

## Equipment and Tactics
March has used several objects over her career including a baton and many bladed weapons she now carries a rapier she habitually imbues with her "sting' effect. She also includes various other loadouts based on the situation, including a sniper rifle and several rubber balls she can charge with her power.
