# Mantellum
Mantellum's area-of-effect power creates increasingly protective layers that block perception powers into or out of his radius by blinding shards. This even affects subconscious ones such as Lung's transformation, and human senses. This effect is so intensive that it blocks even Contessa's power, although it does not work across dimensional boundaries, or video.

According to Cauldron records, his power nullifies sensory aspects of powers within 15 feet of him and conventional senses within 5 feet. However, during the Irregulars' raid, his power's radius is around 100 feet. Although Doctor Mother speculates the Irregulars used a Tinker or a power-boosting Trump to help develop his power, Sveta states that they helped him get strong mostly by giving him a chance to figure out how his power worked.
