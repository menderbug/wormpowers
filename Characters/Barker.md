# Barker
Barker generates a gas with each sound he makes. Which is not linked to what he says at the time, merely the vocal stress he puts on it. This gas can be converted into a variety of effects, including but not limited concussive force (most commonly used), heat and cold, as well as others.

In the battle against a Dragon suit, Barker used his power to create a concussive force that caused it to stumble. He did this multiple times but it made his throat sore, from shouting so many words. He can also use the ability to clear out anything obscuring his mouth and throat.

He is resistant to effects generated by his own powers, but not immune as repeated uses caused Barker's throat to get sore. Though this may have been due to shouting and screaming so much.
