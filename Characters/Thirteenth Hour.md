# Thirteenth Hour
Thirteenth Hour's power causes her opponents (and herself) to pass out and fall into a trance in a flash of light; victims are conscious but helpless under her power. This trance can be broken if something suitably jarring happens to those caught within it though it also carries the risk of waking Thirteenth up as well. She is able to selectively affect people.
