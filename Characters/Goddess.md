# Goddess
Bianca's cluster has a structure that is defined as a 'carousel' by its members. Every day, one member of the cluster would have full power, while the rest would be very weak.

Due to having a full or nearly full connection with six shards, Goddess has an almost unheard of variety of powers.

Her primary power is a Master power that lets her influence anyone in her vicinity, which realigned parahuman cognition into being her subjects. This allowed her to effectively turn her organization into a hive mind with her 'lieutenants' carrying out her orders. It is not infallible however as it can be interfered with, inoculated against, and reasoned out of.

Her second power is her most obvious one, telekinesis; as a powerful long-range expression of this ability she can fly, have super-strength, and manipulate objects and people, given how Khepri used her during Gold Morning. Her telekinesis manifests as fractal patterns in the air, and although she is only capable of moving inorganic objects, she is capable of seizing people by their clothes.

Third, Goddess has a touch-based Trump ability that lets her tune abilities and defenses in a manner akin to Scion.

Fourth, she has a danger sense. Her danger sense will alert her to the strength and direction of any danger that she faces. If the danger is overwhelming, such as in the case of Scion or Contessa, she will feel danger with a distinct lack of direction.

Her fifth power is a personal power battery, that she can tap to strengthen her abilities for limited amounts of time. When used in conjunction with her Master ability, her influence can spread between capes like a virus.

Her sixth and final power has not yet been revealed or is mistakenly ​​labeled as part of one of the other five powers by fans.​
