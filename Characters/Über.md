# Über
Über's power grants him a high level of skill at any specific technique he wants as long as he focuses and concentrates on it. Wildbow commented that people out-of-universe tend to overestimate his power. For instance, he can perform a martial arts recovery but does not have the broader skill, balance and poise a real martial artist would have. Uber did not intimidate Tattletale as she believes even with his power that he still manages to mess up half the time.

Über is largely limited to techniques; in comparison, Victor can learn skills, accumulate knowledge, and carry them with him for a time period. As an example, Über might be able to pull out three different martial arts moves for as long as he focuses and concentrates on them, but he lacks the fundamentals that Victor, in comparison, could collect. However, Wildbow notes that both fall prey to the same trap: however capable they are as a normal, they are limited in being a better than average 'normal'.

He can likely escape handcuffs or ropes if restrained. He can also alter his voice dramatically like an announcer or professional voice actor.
