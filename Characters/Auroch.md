# Auroch
Good grasp of leadership as well as tactics. 

Charley is capable of generating a inertia manipulating field around her that has a controlled series of effects. One permutation dampens inertia, protecting and slowing things in the area, another accelerates them to prompt faster, less controlled movement. She can affect herself independently of this general effect, with some benefits of a dampening effect to protect her alongside the benefits of an acceleration to give her speed. She can be selective in its application.

Aura effect manipulates inertia in radius around herself, with positive bias for herself. She is able to slow down Tanya who is rated as a Brute.

Auroch's field disrupts energy and machinery, which tends to fail or work intermittently within her field. Its use visibly distorts light around it.
Charley is a second generation cape with her powers being derived from her fathers.
