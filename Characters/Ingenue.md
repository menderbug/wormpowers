# Ingenue
Ingenue's power works by boosting one aspect of someone's power in exchange for dropping proficiency in another, such as more power at a loss of control, or more control at a loss of range, which she is able to choose. This has the unfortunate side effect of driving her "partners" homicidally insane after prolonged periods of use. These thralls are noticeably off-kilter to those who know them.

Ingenue can also change her personality into her target's 'ideal woman' which makes manipulating them easier. It is also possible she could see a person's abilities like Chevalier could, if in a more detailed and specific way.

Reliable application of power requires physical contact, though this limitation is later removed by Teacher
