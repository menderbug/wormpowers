# Velocity
Robin has the ability to change 'states' by seemingly altering the way time or physics work in relation to himself, speeding up at the cost of reduced ability to affect the world.

This breaker state enables him to function without shattering his bones while hammering his feet against the ground ten times a second, from getting torn to shreds by friction, or running out of oxygen due to an inability to breathe. However, it also prevents him from so much as lifting even small objects like cups and pitchers, and it makes his punches almost as weak as an eight-year-old's at high speeds; more like a very strong, sentient wind than anything else when attacking. His power seemingly reduces the effect of melee attacks on him, even when he can't see them, although Skitter speculated that may have simply been his enhanced ability to roll with them. It doesn't make him immune to poison.

His perceptions are accelerated as well as his body. At full speed, Velocity is effectively impossible to hit in melee, having several subjective seconds to see and react to attacks. He could also make use of his enhanced reactions to judge the optimal location to place his punches.

Velocity is fast enough to run on water. He is capable of outrunning vehicles. He is the only Brockton Bay Protectorate member capable of keeping up with Purity along with Dauntless.

Grue's darkness interfered with his power in some way. Skitter speculated that it is the same effect that caused it to interfere with Shadow Stalker's power, although it may simply have been that it put up more resistance than air; even the weight of Skitter's bugs seemed to slow him down a little. However, even blinded and with his speed reduced, Velocity is still able to feel his way to targets and strike at them with around half effectiveness.

He is fast enough that insects has difficulty landing on him, and is fast enough to kill the ones that did. However, if he is distracted, he did become somewhat vulnerable. Similarly, he is unable to dodge attacks he couldn't see coming.
