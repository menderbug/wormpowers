# Dovetail
Dovetail has the ability to fly fast, carry people, and leave trails of luminous slivers of light that fall to the ground in her wake. Upon touching something solid they balloon out to make soft forcefields that will then encase those that they come into contact with. These forcefields can be broken out of without too much trouble, even with multiple fields layered over one another, but they impede movement.

She traditionally used this ability to hover over a target and keep reinforcing her forcefields until the PRT arrived to smother them in more containment foam.

## Equipment
Dovetail used containment foam in her costume, able to deploy it against opponents in addition to her power.
