# King of Cups
The King of Cups has the ability to create limbs out of energy, using them for mobility or grafting them onto wound stumps as prosthetics. Weaver speculated that his power tied into the target's nerves and circulatory system. This classified him as a healer.  

Following his second trigger event, he is able to cover an area from horizon to horizon in body parts, both human and nonhuman. Glaistig Uaine then wielded this ability against Scion.

When he is killed, his projections crumbled into black ash.
