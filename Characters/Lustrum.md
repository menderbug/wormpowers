# Lustrum
Lustrum has the ability to sap energy fromÂ everything around her to form a hard light body. The body can be large and roughly the same density as her own, or it can be normal-sized and dense enough to have its own gravity well. Her power briefly cripples the minds, bodies, and powers of anyone nearby.

She was seemingly able to absorb and survive some of Scion's initial, indiscriminate attack, although he was able to damage her breaker form when he focused on her.

Her shard's power well was unusual in some way, which may be related to the fact she drains energy from everything around her whenever she uses her ability.
