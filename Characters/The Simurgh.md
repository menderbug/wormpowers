# The Simurgh
## Psychic Echolocation
The Simurgh lacks the five senses and is blind to the present moment. To compensate for this flaw, she has her own psionic sonar system; she is a clairvoyant. This kind of psychic echolocation allows her to scan her surroundings and gather information to inform her precognition/postcognition.



The Simurgh's psychic echolocation is not interdimensional. It can, however, cross dimensional boundaries: when she is near the interdimensional cracks created after the ice broke, her active scream could now scan multiple dimensions at once.

## Silent Scream
Acting as her passive sonar system, the Simurgh's 'silent scream' constantly collects low-feedback information about the environment, even when she is in her hibernation state. Although it lacks planetary range, its range (i.e., radius) is at least 315 km and presumably covers a large area of the Earth's hemisphere while she is in low Earth orbit. As her silent scream is inaudible, it cannot be tracked or sensed by most individuals, allowing her to subtly gather information without being detected.

Unlike her active scream, her silent scream does not exert a psychic pressure. It is also slower and much less effective at gathering information, which weakens its predictive power. For example, the Simurgh would require a series of passes (over days, weeks, or months) to thoroughly scan and really understand a subject.

## Active Scream
Acting as her active sonar system, the Simurgh's 'active scream' is a psionic signal that she consciously chooses to emit that collects a steady feed of information about the environment. This active scream is optimized for combat: it exerts a psychic pressure that presents an offensive time-intensive threat to her opponents. As a result, her signal is telepathically audible, though it remains untrackable by conventional devices.

Her active scream tapers off with distance. In close proximity, the Simurgh's signal strength is at its strongest; her signal strength is at its weakest near the edge of her active scream range. Her active scream is explicitly range-limited: she would have to fly closer and then emit her signal to even have a chance at working around Dinah's blind spot to figure out what happened during the remainder of the Wardens' meeting.

If desired, the Simurgh can choose to emit a signal with less strength than normal. When going all out, she can deliberately stop using her active scream to better hide her presence and set up ambushes.

A tuned Stilling attack, such as one from Scion, can momentarily cancel her active scream. The Bakunawa Zero can send out pulses capable of disrupting powers to scramble the Simurgh's signal.

## 
The Simurgh perceives the world with her precognition/postcognition, which she also uses to employ long-term schemes that culminate in tragic or destructive outcomes for her deeply-affected victims. While scanning her surroundings and the targets within via her active scream, for every hundredth of a second, she gathers enough data to be perfectly aware of their immediate future (assuming they are not blind spots). The longer she scans targets with her psychic echolocation, the further her power reaches into their past and future (i.e., will keep going until birth/death assuming no blind spots) which she then uses to refine her pretercognition. Indeed, the Simurgh is constantly decoding the data gathered from targets to search for valid levers of manipulation. Thus, the longer visible targets and threats are exposed to her active scream, the better her pretercognition is at assessing them in a fight: they become less effective against her in a fight over time.

She can focus on a single target to decode them faster. In most cases, this focus is necessary when she needs to quickly form a distraction that involves that target or attack them hard enough to create a window of opportunity. However, she cannot effectively perceive everything else while she is focusing.

The Simurgh also decodes data to find more and better prompts to cause victims past their code red threshold to snap. She can then use two vectors of attack in tandem to effectively turn them into Rube Goldberg devices: 1) a long-term psychic influence, and 2) predictions of their behavior and activity (in the order of months and years). These guided missiles typically produce strings of horrific future events in the vicinity of her attacks, long after she has retreated. Note that more time allows her to create more complex chains of cause and effect.

## Information Gathering Time
To inform her precognition/postcognition and achieve optimal combat effectiveness in a fight, the Simurgh explicitly needs time to manually gather information via her psychic echolocation and work out the ins and outs of cause and effect. This flaw is in marked contrast to the powers of Contessa and Dinah who immediately gather needed information.

Before the start of a fight, she has a tendency to reach a position and then remain still while waiting for her opponents to come to her. Once battle ensues, she starts emitting her active scream to initiate her warm-up information gathering phase. At this point in time, she is unable to dodge everything thrown at her: she is less combat-effective because she has not yet gathered enough recent valid data via her active scream. Thus, the Simurgh has a tendency to fight defensively during the early parts of a fight. After years of experience fighting her, humanity learned that doing as much damage as possible at this stage, while also emphasizing chaos and disturbance, is crucial for delaying the arrival of her final phase.

## Blind Spots
The Simurgh cannot directly perceive the Entities and shardspace. For example, she describes Scion as having no apparent past or future. Eidolon is also a blind spot; by design, he is capable of stopping the Simurgh in combat. Shard-derived sensory powers cannot perceive Mantellum (i.e., he blinds shards); he and anyone in his radius are presumably a blind spot as even Contessa cannot perceive him with her All-or-Nothing power.

She cannot see a trigger event directly; it took her several hours before she noticed Dauntless has a broken trigger.

The Simurgh's precognition/postcognition is not All-or-Nothing; other precognitives can interfere with her power. She is unable to directly perceive Contessa, Dinah, and other precognitives (e.g., applicable Teacher thralls, Shamrock). When a precognitive uses their power and interacts with individuals, these other individuals become temporary blind spots. Thus, a precognitive's range of influence can make deciphering the following events difficult and obscure possibilities from her sight. Note that Scion and Eidolon can also use precognition if needed.

Given enough time, she can work around blind spots to some extent. To handle a temporary blind spot, the Simurgh can use prior information to guess their likely course. For non-temporary blind spots, although she cannot directly perceive them, she can potentially observe the aftermath of their actions after they occur in real time by looking at the reactions of visible individuals; she can then guess the blind spot's location using this context. Thus, she appears to favor the shotgun approach when confronting blind spots. According to Tattletale, the Simurgh knows she will be blind sometimes; in a fight, the Endbringer collects and stacks pieces to ideally reach a point where she has so many factors on her side that she can make blind moves and still win.

The Simurgh can be overconfident against sufficiently powerful precognitives, such as the first and third most powerful ones in-universe. During their precog duel, Fortuna and Contessa agreed to work in concert to quickly execute a path without investigating it too much, which forced the Simurgh to leave. Despite being unable to see the remainder of the Wardens' meeting because of Dinah, she erroneously believed there is no reality where the eventual end result is not entirely in her favor. After the disabling of the Mathers Giant confirmed Dinah as a genuine blind spot, Victoria Dallon asked her one last question before extending Dinah's range of influence to every cape present in the immediate area using her aura. The appearance of so many temporary blind spots flowing from Dinah temporarily stunned the Simurgh. It also opened a window of opportunity afterward: the discombobulated Endbringer could only leverage prior information about the surrounding facility and has to restart her warm-up information gathering phase once this temporary blind spot effect disappeared.

## Psychic Pressure and Influence
The psionic signal of her active scream exerts a psychic pressure that the minds of living beings (e.g., animals and people) interpret as an impossibly high and drawn out scream. This scream changes in pitch and tone just often enough to never settle into a pattern. Note that this psychic pressure is psionic in nature as her telekinesis is Manton-limited.

With enough knowledge of a subject, she can evoke memories subconsciously through her posture and actions. By placing a target in a stressful environment, this can be used to cause hallucinations. She can influence machines as well as people.

As the strength of her signal depends on proximity, the intensity of her psychic pressure and the amount of exposure received depend on one's distance from the Simurgh. Although signal strength is the most important factor in determining scream volume, the more sustained exposure one receives, the worse and louder this imagined sound becomes. After years of experience against the Simurgh, humanity came up with a system to evaluate the danger of sustained exposure via two thresholds: code yellow and code red.

When a victim passes their code yellow threshold, they become an increasing danger to others. The stressful environment set up by the Simurgh, combined with a psychic pressure that feels worse with sustained exposure, can affect decision-making and lead to accidental mistakes. For example, when Victoria Dallon thought about finding out whether she killed her sister or not, when something grabbed her, she accidentally hurt Sveta's arm because she initially thought it is her sister. Authorities such as Legend recommend individuals retreat when they are between the code yellow and code red thresholds, or even earlier to play it safe. Indeed, one strategy used against her is to rotate people in and out of her active scream range so that they can reset their exposure and take some time to restabilize.

When a victim passes their code red threshold and breaks down, they effectively become a guided missile that she can use against her opponents. The Simurgh can now place a subtle and long-term psychic influence that alters their behavior, implants messages, or creates compulsions. Note that she explicitly needs time for the victim to pass their code red threshold before she can get her hooks in; this process does not get any faster when she goes all out.

The amount of sustained exposure an individual can withstand before passing their code yellow or code red thresholds is dependent on their mental stability. Several people in any population are already on the verge of a mental breakdown and only need the right prompt from the Simurgh to snap. Emotionally imbalanced individuals (e.g., Noelle, Cody, Shadow Stalker, Taylor, Bloodplay) require much less sustained exposure to pass their thresholds compared with more stable individuals. For example, Victoria Dallon after coming to terms with the Fragile One is highly resistant because she has been dealing with her obvious weak spots for years. Despite enduring the Simurgh's constant psychic pressure for an extended duration in close proxmity, Dauntless successfully held onto his sanity and fought against her during her final flight.

Emotion inducers can help thwart the Simurgh's efforts at breaking individuals and extend the thresholds for others. After Victoria Dallon gained the ability to choose what emotions her aura induced based on her own feelings and memories, she could hit individuals with courage and righteous indignation; these feelings helped them focus their ire on the Simurgh instead of ruminating on negative thoughts. She can also hit individuals with feelings of calm and relief to help sooth emotionally imbalanced individuals.

Blind spots (including temporary ones) are immune to her psychic pressure; they do not hear her active scream. Some powers that protect the brain can also grant immunity to the Simurgh's psychic pressure. Alexandria is immune because she offloads her mental processes to her shard. Cryptid's bird forms are immune because they either detach mind from body, or detach vulnerable parts of the mind from other parts of the mind. Torso felt fantastic when fighting against the Simurgh because of his All-or-Nothing invulnerability.

In theory, a sufficiently powerful telepath can detect the Simurgh's psychic echolocation and also remove her psychic influence from deeply-affected victims. If deeply-affected victims perceive the Mathers Giant, the giant can effectively incapacitate them and keep them pacified by altering what their senses perceive.

## Borrowing Powers
Although the Simurgh is normally unable to make tinker devices herself, her active scream can pull on nearby Tinker powers. As long as Tinkers stay within active scream range, her signal can allow her to borrow their schematics and techniques, copy the design of specific devices present, and collect knowledge to create related tinker tech via a Thinker/Trump sort of approach. The Simurgh can also choose to create a macro-scale version of their devices from surrounding materials. If relevant Tinkers are not nearby, she can only make cosmetic changes to her tinker devices.

Her active scream can allow her to pull on the perception powers of nearby Thinkers and tap into them; as long as they stay within active scream range, she can then borrow those specific powers. When the Simurgh is not fighting during Gold Morning, she tried to stay near Tattletale to pull on her power. However, she still filters these borrowed powers through her active scream: despite having control of the Mathers Giant and being in the same room as Tattletale and Victoria Dallon, she is unable to see Dinah and thus stop the Dinah-influenced Victoria from disabling the Mathers Giant.

The Simurgh is unable to borrow powers from blind spots. For example, despite perching on Titan Fortuna's shoulder during their precog duel, Fortuna still has a hundred times the Simurgh's strength. When Fortuna and Contessa worked in concert to quickly execute a path without investigating it too much, the Simurgh could not tamper with it, forcing her to leave.

## Telekinesis
A powerful telekinetic, the Simurgh is capable of lifting and tossing buildings as if they were softballs. On one occasion, she picked up six buildings to orbit around her. Although he did not actually see the targets, Krouse speculated the Simurgh could strike a hundred targets simultaneously with thrown debris.

The Simurgh can telekinetically create and control "decoys" made from debris. She uses this defensive tactic against Scion because he has a pattern of destroying decoys first.

Because her telekinesis manifests itself as a grip, the Simurgh cannot use her telekinesis on objects that are too slick to grab. Anything sprayed by Withdrawal's yellow fluid cannot be picked up or held by her telekinesis. Her telekinesis is not effective against Chevalier's Endbringer-derived armor and cannonblade.

Sufficiently powerful telekinetics such as the Giantess (i.e., an individual strong enough to lift and throw buildings) can overpower her telekinesis. The Bakunawa Zero can send out spherical waves capable of stripping away the Simurgh's telekinetic hold.

## Manton Limit
The Simurgh is unable to use her telekinesis on biological living entities. As a result of the Manton effect, she also cannot manipulate materials close to the skin, such as bodysuits and presumably explosive armbands. This Manton limit even extends to non-living materials that become part of one's identity; the Simurgh cannot use her telekinesis directly on the Marduk as Defiant truly considered the ship as part of him when plugged in.

She can telekinetically grab costume parts that are not close enough to the skin to be considered an extension of the individual, allowing her to obliquely throw around these specific individuals. Withdrawal's tinkertech frame has mechanical extremities not covered by the Manton effect; she can pin these extended limbs. However, having less vulnerable costume parts can weaken her grip; after Victoria Dallon removed her coat and shoulder decorations, her flight and forcefield could now overpower the Simurgh's faint grip. Withdrawal could still disengage from his tinkertech frame, allowing him to hard counter her telekinesis with his yellow fluid.

## Flight
The Simurgh is capable of flight. Her flight is not dependent on her wings; however, by pointing her wings directly behind her, she can become more aerodynamic.

Although Weaver speculated the Endbringer used telekinesis to move, the Simurgh does not refer to the use of telekinesis when she flies. Her telekinesis is not only Manton-limited, but she could still move even when the Bakunawa Zero cancelled her telekinesis. Eidolon built her from structures that presumably have the common ability of flight.

In the troposphere, the Simurgh is unable to fly fast enough to fully dodge a G-driver blast fired outside her active scream range; she is forced to choose between destruction and a grazing hit. She is also slower than Victoria Dallon carrying Rain O'Fire Frazier; Victoria can keep up with a train travelling at around 100 mph.

Her flight can work outside Earth's atmosphere. After the shard network transported the finished Endbringer to the far side of the moon (i.e., near the end of December 2002 when the moon is closest to Earth Bet), she descended to Lausanne in an unknown time frame. The Simurgh can also fly up and maintain a lazy orbit in the Earth's thermosphere or mesosphere.

## Other Abilities
The Simurgh has incredible durability, at least for her largest wing, and can regenerate thanks to her Endbringer physiology. Like other Endbringers, she cannot be predicted easily with the typical Thinker danger sense and is also a blind spot to the typical precognition, including Contessa. That said, she is not a blind spot for Titan Fortuna.
