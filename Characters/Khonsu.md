# Khonsu
Thanks to his unique Endbringer physiology, Khonsu boasts greater natural durability than any other Endbringer. He has forcefields set between some layers of his body that only disappear after a strong hit; this reinforcement can help prevent an attack from stripping away too many layers of his body at once. His durability and regeneration complement a powerset geared towards mobility and attrition warfare. Khonsu can possibly capitalize on the mistakes made by fatigued opponents.

## Time Fields
Khonsu has the ability to summon up to three fields of accelerated time at a time. To an outside observer, any individual who falls inside one of these zones appears as a blur. People are typically trapped and die within seconds to a minute, leaving behind skeletons or dust. Khonsu's time fields are capable of accelerating time in the order of two years per second; his time fields can erode buildings and collapse them in just one minute to an outside observer. He also somehow set off Russian nuclear weapons with a time field. By using a time field on himself, Khonsu can accelerate his natural regeneration.

From the perspective of someone trapped inside a time field, time appears to flow normally. However, everyone outside the time field looks frozen in time. As they are effectively trapped inside for weeks, months, and years, victims generally die from starvation or dehydration.

By blocking people from entering his time field, Khonsu can possibly crush opponents between his time field and an object. Weaver speculated Khonsu could choose what entered or exited his time fields. However, the barrier of his time fields is indeed Manton-limited. The barrier can only choose to block living organic matter and some forms of energy from entering or exiting. Sunlight and heat do not accumulate indefinitely inside a time field; Weld and some Breaker capes that turn into an inorganic form can escape a time field.

When Khonsu summons a time field, a glowing circumference first appears on the ground. The light gradually intensifies, reaching higher to eventually form a cylindrical forcefield which activates the effect; the space within the circle on the ground darkens in equal measure. Each time field has a diameter of one city block and is tall enough to reach into the stratosphere. Khonsu can dismiss time fields and resummon them elsewhere to catch people who are not fast enough to escape the perimeter before the effect takes hold. At one point, he even managed to time the resummon to catch Legend with a time field.

Summoned time fields orbit around Khonsu; they can move faster than a running person but are slower than a moving car. Thus, a sufficiently fast opponent can dodge his time fields. Khonsu's time fields maintain a steady distance away from him and from each other. However, he can draw them closer or extend the distance in which they orbit around him. Khonsu can also stop their movement and reverse their direction at will.

Khonsu can use his time fields for defensive purposes. He exploded many missiles and shells with his time fields. Khonsu even used the barrier of his time field to block Scion's attacks, though Scion quickly tuned his blasts to pass through this barrier. His time fields also trumped Eidolon's forcefield that was reminiscent of the seemingly inviolable forcefield used to contain Phir SÄ“'s time bomb. Eidolon was unable to break his time fields during Khonsu's debut.

## Teleportation
Khonsu can teleport on a global scale; he typically extends his arms out to either side when teleporting. He can use this ability to target key locations and installations. After his initial attack on Japan, he teleported to Cape Verde all the way in Africa. Khonsu's teleportation can also leave behind a massive, tightly contained explosion powerful enough to throw trucks into the air.

## Other Abilities
Khonsu appears to perceive the world through temporal disturbances. Like other Endbringers, Khonsu cannot be predicted easily with the typical Thinker danger sense and is also a blind spot to the typical precognition, including Contessa.

Khonsu can slowly float in any direction to put himself and his time fields in reach of more targets. He appears to waddle when moving; he floats in the air as if he were walking on the moon. Khonsu can also let himself take a sufficiently powerful hit while floating to gain momentum, letting him temporarily move at higher speeds than normal.

If pressed, Khonsu can fight in close quarters. He managed to clip and shatter an antler of Moord Nag's shadow, though was soon knocked down to the ground.
