# Tecton
Most important is his grasp of tactics and leadership allowing his team to function more cohesively.

Everett is a tinker who specializes in creating power armor suits, see equipment below. He also has Thinker abilities when it comes to sensing and intuiting architecture and geology. For example he could create controlled collapses to cancel out shock waves created by Behemoth, or tell how best to take down a particular building. Thanks to his power armor, and the data collected from Gully, Tecton effectively has shaker capabilities; the suit allows him to ‘ground’ kinetic energy, allowing Tecton to create controlled collapses that can explode.

Further examples of his power includes when he uses his piledriver gauntlets to send kinetic energy into the earth and other solids for a variety of effects. This includes but is not limited to create fissures to sink and hold back enemies. Consequently he is less effective when the medium he is using is soft, such as sands and similar. He can also generate localized earthquakes, and cause controlled demolition of buildings.

Like Gully, he could create ground protrusions to form barriers and similar. He lacked her precision though.

## Equipment


He uses the kinetic force of his pile drivers as a vector for launching teammates and other items such as nets. His suit gives him advanced strength and durability, Letting him go toe to toe with enhanced capes like Hatchet Face. Without worrying about the loss of his tinker powers from the brute's trump cancellation effect.
