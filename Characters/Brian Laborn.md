# Brian Laborn
## Original
Brian can generate clouds of smoke-like darkness that erase all light and mutes sounds.

It also interferes with microwaves, radio frequencies, radiation, and certain Breaker powers such as those possessed by Shadow Stalker and Velocity. He does not actually 'see' this darkness, he is aware of its location and when it is affected but it does not obscure his vision in the least.

His power nullified Shatterbird's sound-based glass control, but Cricket's sonar was able to function in his darkness.

His darkness offers some resistance, like pushing through water, which can make it difficult to keep track of your position. Grue's darkness produces something like a steady air current flowing from his skin when active. This wipes away his scent whenever he uses his power. This makes it hard for those with an enhanced sense of smell compared to base line humans to track him. His power doesn't interfere with smelling other things that happen to be inside his darkness.

His darkness could be moved around by strong winds.

A common tactic of his was to wreathe himself in his darkness to distort his voice and distort where his body is. He can use this to make himself appear larger. He could form rough shapes out of his darkness, including a circular wall. He displays further versatility by making a body double, or several, out of his darkness that was often convincing enough to distract an enemy. This tactic would later be borrowed and improved upon by his teammate Skitter.

Grue is able to cause his darkness to dissipate at will, and could selectively dissipate sections at a time. It naturally faded after about twenty minutes.

## Expansion
After his second Trigger Event, Brian's darkness became thicker, heavier, and came out less quickly, but grew exponentially. He also gained a Trump ability, that let him use the powers of other parahumans while they were in his darkness, suppressing their powers at the same time. He can only access one person's powers at a time, though he can rapidly switch between the abilities he uses.

While using these powers, he was essentially using them for the first time, lacking the experience and skill of previous users. He generally didn't receive the benefit of thinker powers, including secondary thinker powers used to handle the fine details of a power.

After the resurrection his power was adjusted by Valkyrie, specifically by scaling down his trump aspect. Presumably, to avoid power interference between them.
