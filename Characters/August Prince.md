# August Prince
## Primary Ability
August Prince's power stops individuals with the intent to target him from proceeding with an action whose final result could directly harm him either physically or through general deleterious effects. For example, although Arbiter could aim at him, his power stopped her from shooting a sonic blast at him. Taylor could move her bugs towards him, but his power stopped her from moving her bugs to blind, sting, or bite him. Note that for all practical purposes, this does not have a range limit. The Prince's power also stops these individuals from proceeding with an action that they know will immediately trigger a cascade of events whose final result could directly harm him (e.g., giving orders to harm him).

If an individual without the intent to specifically target him has an area-of-effect attack that they have some element of control over, and is also aware that the Prince is in their immediate area, then his power will stop them from proceeding with that area-of-effect attack whose final result could directly harm him.

The effect of his power does not break when he attacks an individual. For example, when August Prince got his hands around Taylor's neck, she and the other heroes could not directly fight to pull him off Taylor because it could have hurt him.

Usher's power does not provide immunity to August Prince's power.

## Vulnerabilities
It is possible to set up a Rube Goldberg machine that could harm him if triggered, though his power would stop the specific individuals that know its end result from taking an action that would immediately trigger this machine. While the Prince was trying to throttle Taylor, she wrapped one end of a silk thread around his neck, and then wrapped the other end around Usher's leg (i.e., these actions did not directly harm August Prince). The Prince's power stopped Taylor from starting this machine: she could not tell Usher to run as she knew it was the final step to setting events in motion that could directly harm August Prince. However, when Taylor notified arriving reinforcements that Pretender was in danger, the unaware Usher triggered the machine by moving away to assist them, thus unknowingly causing August Prince to choke which stopped his attempt to strangle Taylor.

Indeed, incidental damage works against August Prince. For example, Bonesaw's omniphage and plagues have no concept of intent. Wildbow speculates that unless she had the intent to specifically target him with a plague or she was aware he was in her immediate area, she could successfully proceed with an action to release a bioweapon that could incidentally harm him.

After August Prince stopped strangulating Taylor, Arbiter could now throw a forcefield between the two. She then effectively trapped the Prince by sandwiching him between her forcefield and the ground.

It is possible to dodge or intercept his attacks provided these specific actions do not cause direct harm to him.

## Other Abilities
As a child, people tend to underestimate what August Prince can do. He has some skills with aiming, investigation, and situational awareness. However, his fighting style is graceless and telegraphed according to Taylor.

## Equipment
Wields a mace-like scepter to go with his royalty theme. He also packs a pistol, knife, and several syringes with various sedatives and poisons.
