# Axehead
As Axehead, she has a rather inflexible ability to teleport, only near the biggest "threat" in her vicinity and only towards this threat. This ability could be applied in battle by "lining up a shot" and teleporting towards the most dangerous target on the field, hitting any collateral targets on her way towards said target. Her shard has an evaluation mechanism that fixed what the greatest threat to herself is, which means if her actions put herself in danger she could be cut off from her power in the middle of a fight. She could not teleport other people with her.

As the Titan Skadi, all her powers limiters are gone, including those of her human body; her teleporting now seemingly has no range limit. Her shards threat calculation has scaled up into a complete danger sense which she uses to assess the biggest threat and immediately teleports to it. Skadi appears to absorb the light in the area as she teleports, enveloping herself in a shadow wherever she appears.

## Equipment
Generally dual-wielded weapons, on top of having a weaponized costume.
