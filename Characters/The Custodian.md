# The Custodian
The Custodian is a parahuman made of air, invisible and almost completely incorporeal. She is bound to the Cauldron complex occupying the entire structure, essentially omnipresent except in a few key areas.

When she manifests her powers she is shifting where her focus is and incarnating temporary duplicates of herself. She can do this in enormous numbers, which she can either use for combat or to patrol Cauldron's base. She can use her abilities to manipulate objects with heavy or delicate force. Serving as a viable counter and containment measure for the innumerable Deviant cases that Cauldron houses and one-woman maintenance staff.

Her power is limited in application mostly by her attention span or cramped environments.

She is capable of pulling herself back into a human form, but chooses not to the majority of the time.

After Titanification her power was scaled up, allowing her to toss whole buildings at once.
