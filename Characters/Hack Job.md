# Hack Job
Hack Job shared Oni Lee's power of clone teleportation and Hatchet Face's enhanced strength and power nullification. His power nullification is weakened compared to the original, only effective on people close enough to touch.

Hack Job left behind white dust and blood splatters whenever his duplicates exploded. Bonesaw worried about physical wear and tear sustained by his body whenever he teleported.
