# Parian
Parian's power gives her a fine control over lightweight materials. If she attempts to control anything heavier than a half-pound, her telekinesis falls apart. It becomes more unstable when she attempts to move large objects until it expands and dissipates over an area in an attempt to extend control to a number of tiny, lightweight objects.

Parian discovered that she could contain her power and keep it from dissipating. Porous materials worked best for this method as her power soaks into them and allows her to move the fabric rather than just the material. The gaps within the material also allow her to feed power into the 'shell' without it building to critical mass and collapsing.

Wildbow has mentioned that Parian has a "true use" of her power, which is effective against Behemoth, although it is not revealed in Worm.

The true use of Parian's power is later revealed to be working with the skin of dead humans. She can flay corpses and infuse their skins with her ability, manipulating it like she would any other material, but with better control and more strength. She can also use hair and tendons from corpses as thread. By sewing the skins of numerous dead together, she can create a giant construct that is capable of taking an attack from a Titan.
