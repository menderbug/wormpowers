# Nice Guy
Nice Guy's power makes people incapable of perceiving him as a threat. Even if he commits violent acts, those observing him see him as a harmless bystander His power is more effective if he has line of sight with his victims, however those he was unable to focus on were resistant.

People seeing him for the first time don't immediately identify him as a threat. Even when redirected to focus on him, he is effectively immune to notice or ire. Even people fully aware of him and actively on guard for his appearance would not be able to recognize him as a threat.

The original Nice Guy may have been able to use his abilities more deftly than what was seen, but may also have been more reckless.
