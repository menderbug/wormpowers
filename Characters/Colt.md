# Colt
Colt is initially an unpowered henchwoman.

During her Interlude, however, she triggered with a Breaker power. When in breaker state, she is described as having a silvery nimbus of glowing smoke-hair while her body is reduced to a rough, edgy projection of a veiny-purple color, with very limited physicality, including decreased strength and inability to talk.

Her breaker form affects her mental state, as drug-influenced powers tend to do. After leaving breaker form she 'crashes'.

Colt has showcased several abilities. 

Her version of Snag's ability allows her to fly, and turn in a way that Victoria thought is highly maneuverable, capable of stopping faster than any flier Vicky has ever seen.

Her version of Precipice's abiltiy allows her to manifest foot long black energy blades out of each hand, that are capable of cutting through a lamp post. 

Anguished Heart gave her an ability that allows her to create a very short-ranged emotional aura that inflicts intense anxious agitation, enough to fully incapacitate an average person.

Grasping Self gave her a Tinker ability that allows her to construct studs. While in her breaker form, these studs can absorb energy and create hands out of electricity.

Her abilities looked like a "bud" of Love Lost, as she appears in her section in cluster's dreamroom and benefits from tokens given to Love Lost. However, her connection is heavily implied to be abnormal, since her trigger vision strays close to visions experienced during Broken Trigger, while also being "joined" to a cluster purely due to a signal boost from portals (clustered shards are strictly insular in normal circumstances). She, also, is able to influence the dream-visions of her cluster with relative ease, and seems to possess some deeper intuition about human-shard connections.
