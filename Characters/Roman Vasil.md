# Roman Vasil
Roman can induce intense rage in others; however, in doing so, he also inflicts it upon himself. This tends to cause 'duels' between himself and his victims. In addition, Roman is faster and stronger than normal, capable of winning against an adult in unarmed combat. This increased strength appears to also be given to who his power effects.

Roman has a resistance to emotion effecting powers.
