# Othala
Othala had the ability to grant any one of several temporary superpowers to people she touched. However, she couldn't grant any of these powers to herself, and she could only grant one power at a time per person.

Among the powers she could grant were pyrokinesis, invincibility, regeneration, flight, super-speed, and augmented strength. The invincibility she granted allowed the target to stand unmoved in the face of a punch from Leviathan. The regeneration required conscious effort from the user to activate, and it was slower on some body parts than others.

Othala's power was limited to one person at a time. The duration it lasted after she let go depended on the power, ranging from ~30 seconds to 2 minutes, with powers that "bend reality more" tending to "burn out" faster, in terms of duration.
