# Agnes Court
Agnes Court is described as being a Shaker somewhere between Labyrinth and the Yàngbǎn’s Ziggurat in power and versatility. Using it, she can grow artificial organic structures from 'seeds' she creates. These seeds will swell into pillars, stairs, houses etc. growing exponentially given enough time in her sphere of influence. The organic wood-like substance will eventually harden into a stone-like substance of varying colors of her supposed choosing after she has terminated the growth.

Presumably she is able to also work in the micro scale is well. Creating emplacements and shields against opponents; and cages to capture people easily.
