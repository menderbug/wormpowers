# Eligos
Eligos is an aerokinetic, a wind manipulator that compresses the air around him into shearing blades of wind that grow as they travel out, these blades are able to 'boomerang' back to him. These blades have enough shearing force to cut through a modern day cart.

He has some versatility, able to manipulate the wind around him so bugs and projectiles have a harder time trying to cover him. Further, he is capable of causing large gusts of wind to push objects away from him, but he only did this when he is heavily injured and is likely involuntary on his part.
