# Lord of Loss
He has a breaker ability that cloaks him in metallic ribbons, allowing him to shapeshift into any form he chooses.

Initially, he followed someones shapeshifter advice and limited himself to three forms: one resembling a bird, another possibly a tree, another an armored centaur-rhino thing. 'The 'centaur' is the one he uses most in combat. The bird form allows him to fly using his breaker power.

Later, after Marquis' tutelage, he tries to be more inventive and tactical with his transformations.

He is capable of inflating his forms to Endbringer size and crush buildings in passing.

His breaker power multiples his efforts over time, giving repeated actions more effect and power. It lets him hit harder every time he strikes at something, and even with the beats of wing against air, but it still takes time.
