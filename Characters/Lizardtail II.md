# Lizardtail II
Lizardtail is a Healer who emits an aura which regenerates those in the area: causing wounds to close quickly and mend. Skitter notes that his power felt like being by the fire-side, just close enough to feel as though that 'heat' has a physical form, just close enough to be bearable. Instead of feeling hot however, the sensation is almost like a chill. The sensation is directional, making everyone aware of exactly where he is.

His power has a wide range, able to reach across a entire street. It may have also granted it's recipients enhanced durability and resistance to the wounding effects of other powers.

It is unknown if it can discriminate between friend or foe but it can be repressed to some extent as Parian didn't feel it when they met. it is unknown how wide ranging the regeneration capacity is and what wounds it can not treat.
