# Caryatid
Caryatid has a Breaker mode that is indestructible while still and has increased awareness, but she could only move by using her power while in this state. In this form, she did not need to eat; she is unsure about whether she needed to sleep in her form, or what long-term consequences staying in that form has. Caryatid can vary the speed she switches into her breaker state.

She moves by sliding herself across the ground, both inside and outside her breaker state. In battle she acts as mobile bulwark, either by providing her team with a cover or trapping opponents.

## Equipment
Her breaker form has a tendency to damage objects she held, limiting what she could have on her.
