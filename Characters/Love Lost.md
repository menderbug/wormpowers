# Love Lost
## Emotional Manipulation
Love Lost's primary ability is an emotional manipulation power that expresses itself through a roar, she does not have much control over it and as such remains mute most of the time. It is given to her by her primary shard, Anguished Heart. When unleashed it can be particularly devastating wrecking people's emotions and driving them into a frenzy, to the point they can turn on allies. This makes her very effective against groups. This power includes a form of extrasensory perception, allowing her to sense others' emotions.

Solid objects could block the scream.

## Mover power
Highly mobile, able to run on walls with little effort. This is her version of Snags ability.

## Striker
Her claws were exceedingly sharp. This is her version of Rains ability.

## Equipment
Her tinker ability lets her enhance her powers, specifically tinker claws that she attaches to her hands and feet. This power is courtesy of Grasping Self.

Her claws have built-in mo-cap interface, that allow her to communicate with text-messages, when necessary.
