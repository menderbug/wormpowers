# Bambina
Bambina has the ability to launch herself at high speed and bounce off surfaces, and create explosions of fire on contact. She can bounce without creating explosions, or create explosions without bouncing. She can't bounce on water.

Even without exploding, her kicks were sufficient to toss a man across a room hard enough to incapacitate him and to shift one of Dragon's craft.

In addition, Bambina has a slowed aging rate; Weaver referred to her as a "pseudo-child".
