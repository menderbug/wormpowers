# Backwoods
Backwoods produces branches from his back. When he hurls these branches, they explode into a dozen spikes and impale everything around them. They can also work as effective barricades. These branches can also bloom with poisonous flowers, eventually releasing a gas.

Proximity effects cease when Backwoods leaves the range.
