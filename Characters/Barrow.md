# Barrow
Barrow slowly replaces the environment around himself with an otherworldly forest. He can move in this 'borough' effect but cannot move beyond it, though he can extend the borough's radius by standing at the perimeter of it. This change of position means that the area not in his presence reverts to normal.

It is unknown how his powers interact with others.

The resources provided by his zone make him and members of his group essentially self sufficient.
