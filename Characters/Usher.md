# Usher
Usher has the ability to grant "unreliable" defenses, capable of countering Behemoths 'death aura', as well as many other powers. Usher's power is ranged, and only required him to concentrate on the person he is protecting, he could not protect more than one individual. The targets of his power glowed and felt an "energy" or "ripple" coursing through them.

His defenses didn't protect against being pushed or thrown around allowing those with enhanced physical abilities to still effective fight against 'protected' opponents. Essentially while he is able to grant 'single-target power immunity' to others he could not 'protect' against the laws of physics.

Protected Chevalier from the damaging effects of shockwaves, but not from being pushed backward by them. 

Didn't protect against Behemoth's blows.

Didn't make it easier to breathe. 

May or may not have protected against radiation.
