# Vantage
Vantage has super strength and reflexes that scale up depending on the number of opponents he faces, with diminishing returns, as well as a two-to-three-foot teleport. However, he lacks much increased durability.

He carries bolas to use as weapons, maximizing his attack options while teleporting.
