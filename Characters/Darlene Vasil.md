# Darlene Vasil
Darlene can form connections with anybody within her range, these connections need to be anchored on pieces of anatomy her power can immediately recognize. While connected to people, she can feel everything they feel and they can feel everything she does, this allows unfettered communication, coordination, and synchronization. When connected to multiple people, everybody can sense each other, in what is labeled a network. In addition, these people can sense the locations of one another within the network.

It is unknown how far the range of the network extends once somebody is connected, but it has been seen to work over large distances.

This can be used in combat, by forcing her opponent to feel any of the pain they are inflicting on her, or that she is inflicting upon herself. It also greatly enhances her coordination in hand-to-hand fight, but only when tools are not involved.
