# Damsel of Distress III
Presumably her powers are largely unchanged, though her tinker modified arms give complete control of her blasts.

This lets her create things like suspended spheres of destructive energy.

She is immune to her sister's power, just as she is immune to her own.

## Equipment
Her arms count as weapon by themselves, since they are exceptionally sharp; however, they interfere with her dexterity; even damaging the objects she handles.
