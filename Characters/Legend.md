# Legend
As befitting a member of the Triumvirate, Legend is one of the most powerful parahumans in North America. He is considered the epitome of 'flying artillery' capes: he can fire powerful lasers, fly, and endure strong attacks with his energy form.

## Lasers
His lasers were primarily blue-white. These beams can turn corners, fork into multiple lasers, pass through walls, and freeze or ignite his targets. He can use different effects, creating cutting, disintegration, impact, heat, focused, staccato bursts, fat lasers, and invisible lasers. He could combine these effects, but this took time to investigate and he rarely faced threats that necessitated the needed effort. The 'freezing' laser actually lowers the temperature at the point of contact, damaging the target and freezing ambient moisture. The 'heat ray' that ignited a target works on a similar principle.

A known strange feature of his lasers is that they can bend around corners. This versatility extends to him splitting lasers he's fired into multiple smaller lasers. Further, he can radiate an unheard of number of his lasers when he needs to. He can increase the size and power of lasers but requires time to do it. His raw firepower has been favorably compared to Purity or a battalion of tanks. Although the time frame is unknown, Legend managed to deter Sleeper by leveling around 30 km of city.

Legend requires line of sight to properly aim at targets. It is also possible to aim dodge his lasers.

Spatial distortions can affect Legend's lasers. The Impaler Titan could redirect his lasers into his allies with the support of Titan Fortuna, causing Legend to disengage. The Yàngbǎn-assisted squadron of the Taught could slap his more powerful lasers aside by creating distortions in the air that redirected them into the atmosphere or towards his allies.

## Flight
Legend is one of the fastest, if not the fastest, fliers in-universe. During the Battle against Echidna, Alexandria's clones could not catch up to him when he purposefully flew in loops and circles to find opportunities for taking aim and firing at Echidna's clones. While in motion and flying fast enough to appear as a blur to viewers, Behemoth could not pin him down long enough to target him with his lightning.

Legend can accelerate to a speed that exceeds the speed of sound. However, if he continues accelerating, he automatically transforms into his energy form to survive at these speeds. As a result, Legend deliberately throttles his flight speed to avoid going fast enough to lose conscious control of his movements. Although he wondered if his power is intended for travel on an interstellar level, he never tested this theory or determined if his flight speed has an upper limit or not.

During the Battle against Khonsu, Legend and Eidolon managed to get from Japan to Cape Verde in a very short period of time. It is unknown if Eidolon teleported him or if Doormaker opened a portal for them.

## Energy Form
Legend's breaker power changes his body to living light. As he becomes more like light, he is able to fly faster and ignore most attacks, though it impairs his ability to think. While in this state, he absorbs most kinds of energy, using it to repair his human form. This transformation happens instinctively to avoid injury, usually when he is struck or when he flies too fast. It allows him to survive in time dilated environments without food or water by absorbing ambient energy sources. 

Still, attacks from Behemoth,, Leviathan, Siberian, and Skadi have all been devastating enough that they were sufficient to take him out of the fight.

## Other Abilities
As a related minor power, he has perfect, superhumanly clear vision, only blocked by things like solids and gasses like cloud and mist. He took advantage of this by learning to lip read, and to shoot accurately over vast distances.
