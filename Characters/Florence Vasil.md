# Florence Vasil
Flor has the ability to implant severe, permanent compulsions on others that activate whenever a certain condition is met by the victim. She can choose both the conditions and the compulsions she inflicts. The limits of her power are unknown, but she has been seen to force her victims to engage in self-harm or starve themselves, with no apparent way to break the effect.
