# Strider
Strider specializes in mass teleporting, apparently able to bring people to the east coast from as far away as Los Angeles, roughly three thousand miles. It is unknown if this is a single 'stride' or a series of continuous ones.

After his death, Miss Militia described him as "our best mass teleporter".
