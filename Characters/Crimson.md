# Crimson
Crimson powers up by consuming the blood of multiple victims. After witnessing Crimson bulking up, Weaver refers to his power as, "...a little bit of a vampire [schtick], but the end result was more Mr. Hyde." According to Weaver, he was "as hard as iron, strong" after feeding.

Crimson's strength made him agile, able to rapidly climb buildings and leap from rooftop to rooftop. He was strong and fast enough to plow through a wall. He was able to break free of Golem's asphalt arms, and destroy new ones faster than they could be created. He could stab his sword deep into a brick wall. However, Wanton was able to entangle him using spider silk.

He was heavy when using his power, which sometimes caused him difficulty finding supports strong enough to take his weight.

Crimson was largely immune to conventional munitions. He was unphased by a fall of more than three stories, although Weaver believed it would still hurt him somewhat. His skin could be cut by blades or caltrops and hooks, but he seemed not to care. Weaver believed that a strike to the back of his knee would still cause him pain despite his durability.

In addition to his relationship with Winter, their powers worked quite well together. According to Weaver, Winter would use her aura to capture victims for Crimson to feed on, at which time he would take to the front lines and draw fire from her, allowing her to support from range and negating the worry of friendly fire as he would be immune to her munitions.
