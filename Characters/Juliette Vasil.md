# Juliette Vasil
Juliette can make one person freeze as long as she also stays completely still.

Her ability is especially effective when she freezes people who have some sort of momentum going. For example, when confronted with an enemy wearing a jetpack, she managed to freeze them as they were flying around, which resulted in them being unable to stop themselves from smashing into a wall and skidding across the ground.
