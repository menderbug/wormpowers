# Spawner
Spawner powers are a combination of Breed and Crawler. While mostly humanoid, he has rapid regeneration, a prehensile tongue, gliding skinfolds, claws, and is completely alien internally.

He houses his bugs inside his body, and his body is completely shaped around this task, effectively turning him into a walking hive of birthing sacks. He could carry around two hundred of them, and produce hundreds more in some minutes.

His bugs retrieve bits and pieces of his victims as fuel to accelerate Spawner's regeneration and cause him to evolve, which extend to his minions too. The bugs also actively help him to heal, and their biomass can be re-used.

Unlike Breed, Spawner is able to design and preprogram his bugs with specific tasks and orders in mind, choosing their evolutions, although he is still unable to control them beyond that.
