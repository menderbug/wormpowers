# Snubnose
Snubnose generates bursts of sparks from her skin, emanating out in a cone. These sparks, on contact with a surface, imbue it with an antigravity effect and ricochet off surfaces already imbued with the effect, forcefully enough to push objects. The range, however, is rather short, at about eight feet.

Fully armored, Snubnose uses her power to fill her armor, an 800 lb. suit with no mechanical parts. The effect cushions her while making the suit surprisingly light. Vents in the gauntlets allow her to deliver focused blasts at a range of about ten feet. The armor's low weight, thanks to her power, allows her to move surprisingly quickly if needed.

Individuals struck by the power may be flung by the combination of antigravity and forceful ricochet. In confined quarters, the sparks may fill the area, disrupting foes or teammates.
