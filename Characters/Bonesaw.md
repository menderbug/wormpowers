# Bonesaw
Bonesaw is a powerful Tinker whose abilities make her an unparalleled expert in biological, anatomical, and physiological sciences. She is capable of performing a wide array of surgical procedures, which she uses to modify her allies' bodies and her own to be tougher and stronger, and to modify her victims in order to subject them to horrific fates. Her sheer versatility makes her one of the most dangerous Tinkers on Earth Bet. 

Her status was achieved thanks to her long period of activity and the materials she's used in her research. Bonesaw is able to alter the Corona Pollentia, allowing her to modify a parahuman's abilities to a limited degree and combine multiple coronas to fuse two powers into one. In one instance she altered Cherish's power so that she senses negative emotions more powerfully and cannot filter them out, and combining the powers of Hatchet Face and Oni Lee to create Hack Job.

Bonesaw is able to very effectively collaborate with and incorporate tech from other tinkers, likely due to her enhanced connection with her shard. However, although she can get into technologies that are not biotech, she finds working with it frustrating and way slower.

She is very bad at giving names to her creations.

Bonesaw enjoys using vials of chemicals to her advantage. One gas she frequently employed was a white smoke that automatically kills diseases in her radius, useful against plagues that Bonesaw or her teammates were not yet immunized against. It had the side effect of also killing bugs and small rodents, much to the frustration of Skitter. She can create specialized prions, available in liquid and powder form, which cripple the Corona Gemma, disabling the conscious use of powers while keeping the power itself intact. She has vials of white smoke that can congeal into strands of movement-impeding gunk, similar to containment foam.

She has a number of horrifying plagues and poisons designed to inflict painful death. Her poisons had the ability to cause slow, agonizing death beyond that of any natural toxin or venom. She is also able to create epidemic plagues, able to spread to and kill huge amounts of people. However, Jack preferred her not to do this, so the plagues she creates are limited in their spread, an example being a plague she created that caused victims' bodies to explode and spread via bloody shrapnel, which would diminish with every person infected and eventually wear off.

During the Nine's second visit of Brockton Bay, Bonesaw engineered an Agnosia Plague that spread through the water supply and rapidly vaporized into a red, airborne miasma. When inhaled, it rendered people unable to recognize others, causing a spiral of paranoia among the capes of Brockton Bay as they were left unable to distinguish friend from foe.

## Body Augmentation
Bonesaw has modified herself and her teammates extensively. All members of the Slaughterhouse Nine possess a subdermal mesh, reinforced more around the spine, organs, and major arteries, causing them to be much tougher than regular humans. The added protection was powerful enough to even allow members of the Nine to take shots from a sniper rifle. More recently, she installed artificial neurons into the Nine that were able to stay hidden from Cherish's emotion senses.

Bonesaw herself is considerably more augmented. Her body is reinforced like the rest of the Nine, and she has redundant organs, able to function even with her heart pierced. She has numerous contingencies in the event of grievous bodily damage, including a prehensile spine that effectively serves as a third arm when exposed. Her prehensile spine has the ability to extend needles, which can interface with another victim's spine through the mouth to pilot that person's body. She can turn off the pain she felt through an internal 'switch', and is immune to most diseases, venoms, and allergens.

Among her various tricks is her ability to deploy poisons from vents in her body, alongside mechanical traps and needles that can spring out on command. She is also loaded with lethal, potentially epidemic-causing plagues that are set to release into the air upon her potential death. She has capsules in her teeth that she can break to release and spit acid from her mouth. In the case of Master influence on her mind, she has a berserker mode that will automatically activate.

After Bonesaw reformed, Panacea removed everything Bonesaw had implanted into her body. Panacea did not turn off the pain while she was doing this, presumably to make sure she did not miss anything she was removing and because she was still wary of a potential relapse.
