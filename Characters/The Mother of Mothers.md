# The Mother of Mothers
The Mother of Mothers has a scaled up version of Nursery's ability. She has a Shaker ability that spawns minions around her. The minions that she creates are all around ten to twelve feet tall, and some are obese. They are human, and both men and women. The women spawned by her power are all heavily pregnant, while the men are all violently erect. These minions also produce the shaker effect that changes the area around them,  and also can self-replicate.

The minions are not inherently aggressive, but respond to the threats and agitation. The Red Queen has to modify them before sending them against the Machine Army.

As an artificial being it is unable to produce or even survive without intercession from its creators.

After being mutated further by Cryptid, the Mother Giant gained the ability to produce more than just fleshy beings. At one point she created an enormous boneless creature, that is ten times her size.
