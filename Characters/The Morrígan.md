# The Morrígan
As the Morrígan has a Corona Pollentia, Blasto speculated that it would have some blend of Myrddin's and the Simurgh's powers. However, it is a failed experiment and not viable.

Had it been viable, its powerset would require it to do as the Simurgh does and scan thoroughly (over days, weeks, or months) before really understanding a subject. The Morrígan would likely have a limited range; it would focus more on dimensions and energy/material/effect transfers between the real world and shardworlds.
