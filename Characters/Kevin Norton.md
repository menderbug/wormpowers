# Kevin Norton
Kevin is not a parahuman, and has no powers. However, he is the only person Scion ostensibly listens to, able to give him broad commands that Scion will work to fulfill. This indirectly makes him immensely powerful, being the only one able to control the strongest cape in the world.

Even so, Kevin's control over Scion is not absolute. Scion rarely follows Kevin's orders down to the letter, and sometimes outright ignores some of his commands. When Kevin told Scion to kill the Endbringers, Scion only killed Behemoth. Despite Kevin emphasizing it multiple times, Scion never communicated with the heroes. He also never visited or listened to Lisette, who Kevin has told Scion to report to.
