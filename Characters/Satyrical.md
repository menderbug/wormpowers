# Satyrical
Satyrical is capable to shifting his appearance into another person.

Additionally capable of splitting apart into multiple clones in a "oozing process" that starts with a polyp that grows separates from him and then takes on more defined features, he can vary the time it takes for this to happen. These clones in turn have their own shape shifting ability, but while he can make them physically stronger than a target of equivalent mass, he can not replicate any powers they might have. Once killed or dismissed, the clones wither and collapse into bloody messes respectively.

It is unclear how he processes his clones, whether he retains a link to them or if they are largely autonomous. Further, how far his clones can operate from him before collapsing is unknown.

He is very skilled at bluffing, psychology, at least one form of sign language and likely cold reading. All skills essential when operating in the crowded Thinker environment that is Las Vegas.
