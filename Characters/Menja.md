# Menja
Menja had the same power as her sister, a breaker ability that allowed her to shrink incoming attacks proportionately to her size. When Fenja was first introduced, Taylor described her power as giving her the ability to "grow to be three stories tall", and become "a hundred times more durable". She was also capable of becoming six times as tall, taller than even Leviathan, and taking only a sixth of the damage alongside the benefits of being taller. She and her sister were considered strong enough to go toe-to-toe with Leviathan.
