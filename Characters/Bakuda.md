# Bakuda
Bakuda is a Tinker that specializes in explosive devices. She is able to create bombs with an incredibly wide variety of effects, not all of them lethal. Like many tinkers, she could gain increased versatility by studying the powers of other parahumans.

She once created a bomb as powerful as a nuclear weapon, an estimated nine thousand kilotons, and capable of creating an electromagnetic pulse that would cover a fifth of the United States from Brockton Bay using household materials. She has a strong connection to her shard.

Bakuda's abilities were also useful outside a lab. She claimed to have an instinctive understanding of mechanisms and catalysts. She is able to take apart a tinker-designed collar without triggering its defense mechanisms and rebuild it into a bomb, using only her mouth. She is able to analyse some of the Birdcage's defences, although she estimated it would take her a decade to fully understand it. She created a device out of scrap that would punch through a Birdcage exterior wall, triggering the defences. She could fix broken televisions. She claimed that she could literally perform surgery blindfolded.

She didn't always know the effects of her bombs before she tested them. She got bogged down testing and producing the same type of bomb over just creating as much as she could when she could.
