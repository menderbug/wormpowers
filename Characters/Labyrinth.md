# Labyrinth
Labyrinth is an incredibly powerful Shaker, the ability to alter her surroundings at will gains her a Protectorate rating of 12.However, her power comes with several limitations. While moving beyond the boundaries of her power, her range decreases to only a few feet around her; she must remain still for it to extend to its full reach. Further, her power's scope changes in response to her lucidity. The less lucid she becomes, the faster she is able to affect the world around her. This limits her ability to communicate with her teammates and reduces their overall effectiveness. She was not always in full control of her power.

She describes them as pocket worlds, realities that could be influenced by her mental state to take differing forms. She was not restricted by any concrete number but the effort involved in creating a new world was prohibitive next to the cost of building on what was already created. Some of her worlds reflected her self loathing while others were for successes.

When her power is operating well she could cover an entire mall with her effect. Further, she can "anchor" people to be excluded from the worlds she brings in, letting them see and pass through any obstacle she has created and rendering them oblivious to her power. Items she created with her power were sometimes more fragile, as a result of partly existing in two worlds at the same time.

As a required secondary power, Labyrinth has the ability to sense and manipulate the interaction of various dimensions.
