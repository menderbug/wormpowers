# Cask
Lawrence is a tinker who can produce chemical batches to increase strength, flexibility, resistance to toxins, resistance to the elements, resistance to harm, reflexes, or focus. He can also produce chemical batches to restore damaged tissues and prompt rapid cellular growth. One dose is a minimum of 1.33 liters, administered orally, limiting the speed of consumption, emergency application and the number of successive doses that can be given.

Cask treats his own chronic physical ailment with regular consumption of a durability-increasing admixture and can be considered to be a low-level Brute class cape at any given time as a consequence. It should be noted that he still suffers from the ailment, and if at any time he should stop drinking his own mixtures he will begin suffering from it again.

Cask created his own shorthand language for notation purposes when working on his formula.


With the proper readings and research beforehand Cask can brew a draft that when imbibed temporarily nullifies parahuman abilities; these drafts only affect the specific parahuman for whom they were designed. It is unknown how a draft would affect a parahuman with a related power to the intended recipient.
