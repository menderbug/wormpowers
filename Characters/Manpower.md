Neilâ€™s powers come from an ability to manipulate electromagnetism, though only at point-blank range. He has a personal electromagnetic shield around his body that significantly augments both his strength and durability.

His super strength is greater than that of Victoria Dallon. Neil can impart explosive strength when he throws an object (i.e., a power common to both himself and Victoria) to hurl it faster than what is possible with super strength alone.

Neil has the ability to attract nearby metal objects to his hand (e.g., a store shelf). He can also discharge his shield to deliver high impact or electrified hits.

He is tough to hurt. His shield allows him to take consecutive hits from Marquis's bone scythe, run into spears of bone, and be thrown through a brick wall to little or no effect. That said, his defense is not All-or-Nothing.
