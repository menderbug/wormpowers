# Breed
Breed has the ability to create trilobite-like parasites that become more dangerous over time. They emerge at about the size of a lemon from his orifices. He could create nine or ten a day. The original Breed may have had greater skill and power than his clones.

Despite their arthropod appearance, Breeds trilobites are best understood as organic automata, emulating life without truly 'living', 'running' off of a instinctual programming script. Weaver's power is unable to 'register' and control them, due to the creatures not being around at the time her power was defining what counted as a "bug".

When released they will ignore hard targets and go after the more vulnerable prey and corpses provided they're not already infested. They probably feed exclusively on humans, but they would attack non-edible targets to remove a threat.

## Minions
## Larval Stage
They are described as resembling trilobites, with hundreds of small legs, spines, and long tails equipped with stingers. They're resistant to conventional weapons, but not totally immune to knives or Weaver's bugs. Thanks to their small size they can lurk in spots where they can get access to orifices, sites of injury, or corpses. Then burrow inside, wait until the target is still and quiet for an hour or two, paralyze the target, and emit pheromones to call their fellows to them. Their barbed skin makes it difficult for them to be removed. They devour the target from the inside out, molt once or twice as they digest the fats and proteins they ate, then find a new target. Their limbs are tipped with sharp claws that can penetrate flesh, cloth, and even spider silk, making them difficult to dislodge. The legs can be retracted into the hard carapace to protect them. They make a hissing noise as they move. They're usually slick with gore from previous victims.

## Nymph Stage
In a process that takes one to two weeks, depending on the availability of food sources, the creatures will reach the size of a full-grown human being. After this, they’ll do two or three major molts with big physical changes.

## Imago Stage
In their final form, the creatures develop a number of natural weapons, including a shotgun spit composed of pellets which dissolve into a flesh-melting acid.
