# Cradle
## Tinker ability
Cradle primary ability is a Tinker one, with a specialty in making limbs. He has a dedicated workshop. His primary ability comes from the shard, Grasping Self.

## Equipment
Cradle collaborated with others in his trigger group, designing things with them. By the time of the attack on the Fallen compound, he has been refining his equipment for around a year.

## 
Cradle could imbue his tech's attacks to let them hit with an explosive force beyond what they should have hit with. Victoria speculated that this might have been his version of Rain's Blaster power, or otherwise an adaptation of another Tinker's tech. It is later proven to be the case, as when he took Rain's tokens on their sixth night in the dream room, he described the ability to run this power through objects.

The upgraded version of this, resembles a Shaker ability, as Cradle can summon glowing lines in the area surrounding him, that cut anything they intersect, including powers. These lines stay stationary wherever they are placed.

## Mover Power
In addition, he appeared to have an intuitive ability to stay balanced, even while standing upon his hand mech; this is his version of Snag's Mover power. This ability, when supercharged with extra tokens, allows Cradle to warp space in a way that allows him to move between spaces extremely quickly, in a way that resembles teleportation.

## Emotion Power
Cradle also has a secondary emotion power, his version of Love Lost's power. When boosted, it allowed him to sense people in his vicinity.

Cradle's emotion power allows him to sense the emotional weaknesses in people, letting him know exactly how far he can push things with them before they will break.

This ability comes from his connection to Anguished Heart.

## Cluster Dynamic
Unique to Cradle's cluster, every night, Cradle and his cluster-mates re-lived their memories of the mall incident and were placed in a room where they could exchange tokens to shift the balance of power among the cluster. Cradle's tokens were coins. After Snag's death, as the power balance began to be more uneven, Cradle is apparently stronger

He has gained good experience using his knife.
