# Bamet
Had the ability to imbue animals with human traits, at the expense of stealing them from human subjects. These changes are permanent. He does not require touch to make these changes. The mutated creatures have some measure of sapience and sophoncy, thus they can be used to relay information, and carry out a multitude of other tasks.

How much they change is based on the animal used and the amount that Bamet has worked on them.

## Equipment
Thanks to his power, the Fallen have a good source of leather goods to sell and outfit themselves with.
