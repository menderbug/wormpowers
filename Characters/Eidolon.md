# Eidolon
He has the ability to equip himself with a tremendous array of varied powers but is limited to holding a few at the same time.  He typically uses three, though he can take more at the cost of potency if required. The powers he chooses take time to build up, but within minutes he can match the strength of veteran users of the same abilities.

Even though his power is one of the strongest, he does not have much control over it. He is limited to holding tighter to or discarding given powers, which are selected by his shard in accordance with what it perceives David needs. As a consequence, Eidolon does not have enough awareness of his complete repertoire of powers.

Although he can use tinker powers, his access to other powers and the long-term element inherent in tinker powers vs. something like a blaster power of the same utility factors into their negligible use.

His powers' potency, however, has been slowly weakening over time. Powers he summons take longer  to build up and reach max strength, their maximum strength isn't as great as they should be or once were, and he's losing access to more powerful abilities like Matter Destruction. This leads him to look for a sense of challenge, in order to seek the untapped well of power he can feel when he is fighting. In the meantime, he's been using Cauldron vials as booster shots. Eidolon speculated that Ignis Fatuus is not as restricted as he is, and perhaps if Glaistig Uaine claimed his power, she would not be as well. Skitter, however, speculated that Ignis Fatuus is enhancing his power using a variant of Scapegoat's power.

He is later able to restore his energy reserves by digging up the power to sense and drain the shards of other parahumans, based on advice given to him by Glaistig Uaine.

While Eidolon can access a huge berth of abilities he does not gain much individual proficiency with his abilities. Thus it is possible for him to do things like concuss himself on forcefields he created. He does not develop the instinctual connection other parahumans have with their powers.

Glaistig Uaine referred to Eidolon's shard as the "High Priest". It is the Thinker's counterpart shard to the Warrior's Queen Administrator.

## Relation to Endbringers
Eidolon is the unwitting creator of the Endbringers. His power gives him what he needs; according to Scion, Eidolon subconsciously needs worthy opponents. Tattletale speculates the Endbringers gave him the opportunity to use his abilities to their fullest and make a unique difference, i.e., a true fight. This subconscious need might be a result of his savior complex, an eagerness to prove his usefulness, and a desire to leave behind a positive legacy to others.

His power hooks up Endbringers to its well and allocates them vast energy reserves. The addition of these massive energy drains arguably explain why his powers weakened over time; more Endbringers would accelerate this drain. Only when fighting against Endbringers can he sense these energy reserves and thus feel as if his lost power is within reach. In theory, the creation of more Endbringers and the resulting drain could eventually push Eidolon to the point where he would learn (without the help of Glaistig Uaine) how to drain the shards of other parahumans.
