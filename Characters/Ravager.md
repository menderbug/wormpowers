# Ravager
Ravager is a Grab-Bag Cape who could imbue weapons, objects, and ammunition with the ability to inflict gradually worsening wounds which smoked and stung. All wounds Ravager inflicted would bleed, fester, and permanently scar if not tended to, with scratches having the potential to worsen into evisceration. She maintained a clairvoyant awareness of those she wounded.

Ravager also has enhanced fighting ability, possessing several minor powers that resulted in an enhanced physique.
