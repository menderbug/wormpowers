# Auger
Auger has a Blaster ability that manifested as a beam of light. With this beam of light, he could bring things in from other dimensions. This ability followed a set rotation. One beam replaces anything it hits with sparks. The following beam would replace anything it hit with flowers and pollen. After a time, these flowers and pollen would revert back into whatever they has replaced. The next beam is one of radioactive desolation.

Later in his career, his shard also rewarded him with a Mover aspect that allowed him to travel interdimensionally, by focusing his beam on himself.

As a Titan, his blaster power is vastly amplified. Auger has also gained the tinker aspect and could dismantle parts of the Machine Army to make use of them as raw materials for his inventions. This tinkertech is used to further enhance his blaster abilities.
