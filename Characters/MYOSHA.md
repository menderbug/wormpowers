# MYOSHA
MYOSHA is a shaker, who can create heavy industrial equipment out of the ground. She is capable of manifesting things like mechanical claws, molten hot metal, giant pincers, an enormous crane mount and wrecking ball, and giant buzz saws.

Her ability has a limitation in which, three 'splashes' occur before she can summon anything significantly large.
