# Dragon
Dragon is known as the best tinker in the world, head and shoulders above any of the other tinkers that went out in power armor. She wore a different suit each time she deployed. Some fans argued she is the most powerful parahuman on Earth Bet, although this is more usually credited to Eidolon.

Her ability allows her to copy, understand, and elaborate upon the designs of other tinkers. It is useless without other tinkers to copy from.

## Creations
Dragon has designed and created a plethora of mechanical suits of armor that serve a variety of purposes. While the suits differ in size, shape, and weapon systems, they are all generally quadrupedal with a draconic design aesthetic.

Dragon also utilizes smaller units and drones, which she uses to maintain the Birdcage and for other logistical needs. Some of these units are basketball-sized while others are larger and serve general utility, rapid response and rescue purposes. These units and drones are armed with tranquilizers, electric pulses, containment foam and tear gas if they are armed at all.

Other things Dragon has created include the Birdcage itself, the collar worn by Canary, the loadouts for the specialized grenade launchers used by the PRT officers, and the containment foam sprayers (both civilian use and the larger turrets mounted on her fast response suit and on PRT vans). She is also responsible for many of the computer systems that the Protectorate makes use of. With the assistance of Armsmaster, she designed a computer program to predict the movements of the Endbringers. She has created surveillance devices and programs that she is confident could track another tinker without being noticed.

Dragon created the armbands used by capes during Endbringer fights. They has a screen capable of tracking the user's location along with the enemy's last known location; and two buttons used for calling for help and sending messages to the others wearing the armbands. Dragon created software that screened and interpreted messages before sending them out, and directed people to help those in need of assistance. The armbands also tracked the user's vitals, sending out an alert if they were injured or killed.

A few weeks before the Slaughterhouse Nine attacked Brockton Bay, she supplied the Protectorate ENE Headquarters there with a 3D printer of her design. She used it to create modified, prototype prosthetics when Colin Wallis is injured to save his life, based on her own designs for a gynoid body.

## Innate Abilities
As an artificial intelligence, Dragon possesses a number of superhuman capabilities. She thinks faster than an ordinary human. She doesn't need to sleep, and can operate continuously without pausing to rest. She can hack through Armsmaster's "heavy security" in moments. In the time it took Armsmaster to send her a file, she is able to read all his notes for the time since they last spoke. She can also intercept and seize control of phone calls.

Dragon's suits possess a number of traits that led Tattletale to conclude they were unmanned. However, Regent could detect a nervous system inside, and Skitter observed a strange, stunted creature "piloting" them. The truth is that Dragon downloaded herself into a bio-computer in the suits, then restored herself from a backup if they were destroyed. It takes her about 30 minutes to load from a backup.

## 
Dragon maintains a number of programs made by her creator, Andrew Richter. She has a web trawler designed for monitoring emails that watched web traffic for "high-risk content", such as attempts to sell data stolen from her or references to the secret identities of Protectorate members. It could search through records and security footage for clues to rapidly uncover a parahuman's secret identity and track specific individuals. In places with security cameras and lots of internet connectivity, it can track down an individual in seconds. She also maintains the program Richter used to monitor his house, which tracked the activities of inmates in the Birdcage for her.
