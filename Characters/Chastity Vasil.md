# Chastity Vasil
Chastity has a Striker power which manifests as a dark blue glow around her hands. Upon making contact with a person, Chastity can inflict 'distilled defeat' upon them, usually taking that person out of the battle. Each person she affects appears to cause one of her fingernails to glow.

The severity of Chastity's power is affected by how powerful she is in her target's eyes; the more confident she appears to her target, the longer and stronger her power hits. If opinion of her is taken down, the effect dissipates, and Chastity suffers herself.

Chastity has a secondary Thinker power that allows her to sense the bodies of people in close vicinity of her. This sense also appears to apply to those she uses her power on. This serves to assist her aim with her primary power.

## Equipment
Separate from her power, Chastity carries a whip, which she uses in combat to distract and repel enemies. She also wears a lot of heavy jewelry.
