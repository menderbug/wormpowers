Mimi is a pyrokinetic who can teleport herself freely through flames. She becomes increasingly psychopathic the more fire is nearby. She is also completely fireproof.

Mimi's pyrokinesis is extremely versatile. She created concussive fire blasts capable of knocking over the Undersiders and  Bitch's dogs, shot twin flamethrower-like streams of fire from her hands, and could send fire "snaking" across water. She could put out her fires at will, create walls of fire, and leave burning footprints that widened into a trail of fire. She could also throw fireballs that could punch holes through walls by summoning fire to her palms and hurling it. Out of battle, she shaped her fire into foot-high images of characters from her comic books and from her memories while reading.

Using her power adjusts the chemical balances and connections in her brain to reduce her empathy, impulse control, and emotion, so she "can’t help" using her power if there’s fire nearby. This creates a cycle where Mimi is increasingly unlikely to stop using her power the more she uses it.

Mimi's eyes glowed and would occasionally flash orange when her power is active.

Bonesaw also modified members of the Nine with various "safeguards"; sheathing their vital organs and major arteries in a protective sub-dermal mesh, further wire reinforcement is put into the skeleton to avoid broken bones, with special attention is paid to the organs and spine to keep them functioning. She also rendered her teammates resistant to her pathogens, and granting them artificial neurons which allowed them to make plans Cherish could not see, it is unknown if this could be adapted for other Master powers.
