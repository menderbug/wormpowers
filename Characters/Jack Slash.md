# Jack Slash
## Primary Ability
Jacob's primary ability extends the effective cutting edge/stabbing tip of any handheld edged weapon far beyond its physical dimensions, which gives him practically nigh-infinite range. The physical blade itself is not extended; he uses an 'imaginary' projection that does not damage the actual blade while in use. Not to be discounted is his long experience with using various knives.

As the projected cutting edge applies the full force of his swing, this helps augment the strength of cuts, thrusts, slashes, and stabs by a fraction because the swing/blade does not stop where a weapon normally would. However, this does not make cuts more severe; it only extends the strength and severity of cuts to the peak point in the blade's movement. What Jacob can actually do with a weapon is still limited by the physical capabilities of the blade itself; for example, he needs an actual butcher's cleaver to sever limbs instead of a dagger.

## Manton Limit
Although his power is not limited to knives, it only applies to edged weapons that he is holding. Jacob also finds knives faster and easier to handle. Thus, he cannot extend effects on weapons such as Armsmaster's Nano-thorns as only the cutting edge of the blade itself is projected.

As the Manton Effect treats Hookwolf's metal parts as inorganic, Jack's power can affect the blades of a shapeshifted Hookwolf that he is riding. The ability to do so is likely linked to his long and successful time as a murdering maniac granting Jack great facility with his power.

## Body Augmentation
To help protect her teammates from lethal harm, Bonesaw augmented Jack and some other members of the Nine with wire reinforcement for their bones and tinkered sheathing (i.e., subdermal mesh) around their vital organs, major arteries, and spine. Against standard guns, this sheathing helps distribute the impact of bullets to make lethal damage far less likely. For example, when Taylor fired Trickster's small handgun at Jack, the bullet's impact knocked him to the ground and gave him some pain, but failed to incapacitate him because she hit him close to the spine. When Trickster fired a sniper rifle at Cherish (who also received this sheathing), she is only left incapacitated by the bullet to the stomach, albeit bleeding severely. Note that bullets and knives can still perforate his body. Despite the wire reinforcement, Jack can still crack his head open by banging it hard enough against an object.

Bonesaw also augmented Jack and some other members of the Nine with built-in antivenom and antibiotic injectors. She rendered her teammates resistant to her pathogens.

Another augmentation that Jack has is a switch that allows him to turn pain off. However, this switch takes a second and deliberate action to activate. After Gray Boy looped him, despite initially being able to give himself a second or two of relief each loop, Jack inevitably lost his mind and the concentration needed to turn off the pain.

At some point after Cherish encountered the Nine, Bonesaw augmented him with artificial neurons that were hidden from Cherish's power.

## Shard
Jack's powers are the result of receiving a crippled Broadcast shard from Scion. In its non-crippled form, the Broadcast shard is originally used to manage communication between the Entities. Although crippled to not work on Scion and Eden so that they can kill Jack without issue and to avoid distracting them, the Broadcast shard still retains its executive function for communication between shards. When deployed during a cycle, Jack's shard in the shard network is analogous to an executive officer or CEO for the other shards. According to Scion, the Broadcast shard is not particularly aggressive in comparison with the typical shard.

Because of Jack's close connection with his shard, it believes an active Jack is preferable over letting him die. Behind the scenes, Jack's shard specifically utilizes the shard network to sabotage parahumans who work against him. By interacting with other shards, these other shards may choose to favor Jack instead of their owner in subtle ways:

Note that his shard is better at sabotaging parahumans such as Ash Beast and Khepri whose loss of self gives their shards more of a say.

Although Jack's shard can only sabotage for defensive purposes to protect only Jack, it allows him to generally triumph over parahumans in a fight where possible and instinctively avoid situations where he cannot beat the parahuman opposition. Thus, parahumans cannot kill him without outside interference. This secondary power allows him to effectively beat powerful parahumans such as Citrine, the Siberian, Gray Boy, Number Man, and arguably even Contessa. It also allows him to avoid dying to an unexpected trigger event or second trigger event.

As Jack triggered at a young age, he expanded the breadth of his power as he grew up. His close connection and personality led to his shard also giving him enhanced intuition regarding parahumans; this allows him to better manipulate them and find their weaknesses. For example, he has better control over Gray Boy compared with King because he intuitively knew how other parahumans operated, their weak points, and their motivations. However, Jack can be misinformed. He erroneously believes Skitter triggered because of her mother's death. He also has no clue the Siberian is a projection until Manton told him.

Jack's shard does not give him mind control. When he tried to recruit Panacea, he and his shard has no real influence or push on her (i.e., what she did to Victoria is ultimately her decision alone). He failed to convince Harbinger to stay with the Nine, get Marquis to break his rules, and get Skitter to kill Battery even with the help of Bonesaw's agnosia plague. Jack specifically asked Bonesaw to only clone one Gray Boy as he did not know if he could manage more.

The secondary power provided by his shard is so subtle that Jack himself is unaware of it. Handing out this shard is standard procedure because it gives Scion and Eden the opportunity to see how the host species interact with a seemingly unbeatable secondary power.

## Vulnerabilities
To neutralize or kill Jack Slash, one must rely on an individual who is not part of the shard network, as they are effectively a blind spot to the Broadcast shard and cannot be sabotaged. When Golem figured out Jack's secondary power, Dinah's power successfully confirmed that Golem's plan to send in a D. T. officer against Jack is the right move. Golem then ordered a D. T. officer to distract Jack. Despite Dinah's power providing an optimal path and timing, and Golem's power pointing the officer in the right direction and moving him into position, Jack is completely unaware of the incoming distraction. Lacking a shard, the officer armed with tinkertech successfully distracted Jack by spraying containment foam in his direction. Although the containment foam did not actually reach Jack, this distraction is more than enough for Tecton to punch Jack in the stomach and escape being held hostage. Gray Boy, disgusted by this weakness, turned on Jack and looped him; the D. T. officer's interference meant Jack could no longer beat Gray Boy. This resulted in a genuine defeat for Jack, whose shard wanted him to stay active, and ultimately led to his death.

Although Scion can successfully kill Jack if needed, Jack's cape kill count is not high enough to merit his interference. However, Scion did see a possible future where he stood over Jack's corpse.
