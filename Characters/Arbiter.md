# Arbiter
Arbiter has minor forcefield, sonic laser powers, and a social Thinker power, a variant on a danger sense she calls a "riot sense". This makes her aware of the threat level of individuals associated to her target, not including that person, in terms of color. She is well versed in using her forcefields and a sonic laser in combat. While her forcefield lacks the durability or versatility of other heroes she is adroit in its use. This seemingly unconnected selection of powers are hallmarks of a Grab-Bag Cape but the circumstances of her trigger event are largely unknown.

She also demonstrates the ability to learn languages unnaturally quickly, with her Portuguese advancing from broken to flawless after three exchanges with native speakers. She also speaks Chinese and a local language from New Delhi. Weaver describes her voice as "oddly melodic". It is unknown whether this ability is distinct from her other powers or has other applications.

She also has some medical training.
