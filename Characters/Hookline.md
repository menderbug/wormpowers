# Hookline
Hookline has a hundred foot long cable with a hook on the end that he telekinetically controls. Only he can control or influence it. It could be described as an All-or-nothing ability, as the cable cannot be broken or damaged.

Hookline is capable of moving people around with his chain, by having teammates balance on top as he moves the chain around.
