Her cape name is extremely literal, having rusty nails for teeth, yet it is also misleading. Her power is to extend any part of her body into a dangerous implement. Usually, this means her arms and legs but it also means her torso, fingers, and toes, or any other body parts can be stretched to fine, barely visible points, while at the same time being durable, maintaining rigidity and joint mobility. She can even weaponize her tongue.

She can expand her face to something more like a crocodile so that she can bite people. This interferes with her ability to speak, to do so she needs to pull her face back into a more human shape.

It also gives her a certain amount of strength and speed, though this seems to only apply in her Changer form, able to cover a good distance with her stride. She is also able to use her ability to enter through tight spaces.

Although durable, her stretched parts can be damaged, and transfer damage once returned to normal.
