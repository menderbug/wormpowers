# Krieg
Krieg can affect kinetic forces in a wide radius around him, though the strength of his manipulation tapers off with distance (i.e., strongest in close proximity which gives him his Brute rating). For example, he can slow down, disrupt, or deflect hostile forces via controlled, unconscious alteration of air friction/resistance. Hostile enemies may have trouble breathing. In addition, his actions have increased results for energy involved: his punt sent Manpower flying through a brick wall. However, sufficiently powerful kinetic attacks such as a melee charge from Leviathan can still take him out of the fight.

Victoria's aura causes him to get angrier instead.
