# Hunter
Hunter produces a mass of thin black wires within thirty feet around herself, that cuts everything in its way. She is immune to their sharpness herself.

Initially, her power is barely controllable, lashing out at any sensory cue. Amy is able to make it more restrained, but with ensuing personality alteration it made little difference.

Hunter's power permanently maintained her heightened psychological state, as such she does not get mentally tired.

As a Titan, she can produce razor wire within a quarter mile of herself, which scales up over time and is not Manton limited. Unlike the majority of titans she is extremely agile.
