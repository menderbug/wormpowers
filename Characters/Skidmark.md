# Skidmark
Skidmark has the ability to create a deflector effect, a type of force field that push things with about as much force as a gusty wind. In fact, it can exponentially increase any force put into it. His power caused the affected area to glow with a blue to violet color effect.

He can apply this effect on any surface, up to a large but finite limit, roughly that of a soccer field. He could even coat his equipment and living things with the glow, causing anything that touched them to be pushed away with enough force to smash through metal pipes. He could not move an effect after it has been applied, but could dismiss it at will in a flash of light.

Skidmark has shown that the effects can be layered up through multiple uses of his power increasing the severity of the effect. With enough applications of his power layered on a surface he could theoretically deflect bullets, or even topple Endbringers. Still he ran up against limits such as, a steady stream of material could knock him down, especially when he did not have time to set things up. It could be applied to a surface causing all objects on that surface to be immediately affected. As long as he has eyes on his creations they stay functional.

## Rating
He did not effectively explore the use of his power, limiting his effectiveness, and lowering his PRT rating. Technically his power is more of a Mover than Shaker but this is not reflected in his official classification.
