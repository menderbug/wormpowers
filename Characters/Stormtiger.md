# Stormtiger
An aerokinetic, Stormtiger has developed several unique applications for his abilities. His signature technique is to condense air into hard ‘claws’ that he can use for CQC or to launch as projectiles; he can then release the condensed air in explosive blasts. The more time he has to draw air into the claws, the larger the resulting explosion.

Another of Stormtiger's techniques involves drawing sounds and smells towards himself, effectively enhancing his senses. His ability to sense air currents helped him to detect incoming projectiles.

Stormtiger could also generate simple blasts of wind. He could deflect projectiles, including bullets, through his manipulation of air currents.

He could also use his aerokinesis to achieve limited flight, essentially floating in place.

## Equipment
At one point, his leg is injured and ended up healing incorrectly, requiring a cast.
