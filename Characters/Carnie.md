# Carnie
All Carnies have the same abilities as the original Circus or variations thereof. One Carnie showcased the ability to suck air into their pocket dimension, creating a vacuum and dragging flying capes toward it. The same clone also showcased the ability to light an entire person on fire just by touching them. Another Carnie has the ability to fold themself into their pocket dimension.
