# Snag
Snag is a grab-bag cape. His main power is mover, but he is also quite proficient tinker, that can apply emotion-affecting states from his gadgets, and striker.

## Mover power
He can treat any direction as 'down', that allowed him to leap without jumping movement, land on a ceiling or on a wall. In open spaces Snag is capable of pseudo-flight, although he has to be careful about velocity.

## Tinker Ability and Equipment
Snag's Tinker ability manifested in a way that allowed him to create large gauntlets that fit over his arms.

His Tinker ability comes as a courtesy of Grasping Self.

## Emotional Manipulation
He can force negative emotions on people he touches with his gauntlets, or apply dedicated emotions from his tinkered projectiles.

His emotional attack is accompanied by a mechanical humming from his gauntlets as it charges, but Victoria believed it is likely part of "a full-fledged emotion affecting ability".

His emotion ability comes as a courtesy from Anguished Heart.

## Striker
He could use his variant of a specific blaster power to easily punch through walls, and other inorganic materials. This is his version of Rain's primary ability.

## Cluster Dynamic
His power waxed and waned over set intervals. When he fought with Victoria he is near his peak.

The Cluster he is a part of has a unique setup, where they would be forced into a dream room every night. Here they could exchange tokens that represented their individual primary abilities.
