# Lung
Lung has an enhanced physique, being stronger and more resilent than typical, with pyrokinetic abilites and excellent recovery abilities. What truly sets him apart is that his power caused him to gradually transform, making his powers more potent the longer he was in a fight. He healed at a superhuman rate, got stronger, got tougher, got bigger, and he grew armor plating complete with blades at each fingertip. His scales resembled knives or spades, and were bulletproof.

As a product of his personality and durability he has some resistance to Master powers, such as emotional manipulation and pain or pleasure induction,  tending to respond with anger. However some Master effects, like Goddess', overpower this trait.

## Transformation

Lung's physical transformation began with scales growing over part of his body, providing armor. His fingertips sprouted claws. After a short while, his back would abruptly grow, sprouting scales and making him grow a foot taller. A similar tear and subsequent sprouting of scales might come at his shoulder.

At some point before his body was entirely covered in scales, he was sufficiently large and durable that any bullets striking his exposed skin didn't do much to slow him down, nor did slivers of metal.

By the time he was seven or eight feet tall, his shoulders were easily three feet across, and he was completely covered in scales. He was still able to speak normally, and he was still vulnerable to pepper spray, although it wore off unusually quickly. He was strong enough to make Bitch's dogs rear back from the impact. The dogs were able to subdue him, although he was weakened somewhat by the venom from Skitter's bugs.

He grew wings if he fought long enough, although this was only a rumor to the public. By the time he was nearly fifteen feet tall, spear-like wing-nubs stuck out of his shoulders. His voice was distorted; the shape of his skull and face were more catlike than human, and his nose and mouth were a single X-shaped opening, bristling with pointed teeth that stuck in every direction. His neck alone was nearly as long as Taylor's torso and thicker at the base, tapering down to a more or less normal sized head. He could bend his neck in a ‘u’ shape to look behind himself. He was strong enough to leap to the rafters of a warehouse, and to throw one of Bitch's dogs across the room. He employed martial-arts-like throws, which Taylor speculated might be a result of enhanced reflexes and flexibility rather than skill. His fingers were tipped with foot-long blades. His armour could be penetrated by Kaiser's blades, but he was tough enough to survive even serious wounds. He was strong enough to overpower Victoria Dallon's superhuman strength.

Lung's wings then unfurled, batlike with silvery scales where the bat had fur, and dark red flesh that stretched between the ‘fingers’ of the wings. His entire midsection rearranged so he stood another foot or two taller. He was faster, stronger, more maneuverable. His increasingly alien "face" extended down the sides of his neck. He was strong enough to tear or bite through his own limbs. Although Goddess's telekinesis was able to stab numerous metal spears through him, he wasn't stopped by the injuries, nor by tearing off his own arm and hand. He was able to recover from having his torso split open in moments without slowing down. 

By the time he was as large as Leviathan - that is, thirty feet tall - he had four wings, four hands, and two digitigrade feet. He was bristling with layers upon layers of silver scales.

At the most extreme end of his transformation he was larger than Leviathan and capable of trading blows with an Endbringer; four wings extended from his back. There wasn’t a hard upper limit to how strong he could get.

Although Taylor believed that Lung "only started returning to normal when there was nobody left to fight", his power actually began to leave him during his fight with Leviathan. His passenger decided when he could  transform and by how much, enough potential conflict could warrant further transformation and use of its vast, but still limited, power reserve. He transformed faster against more formidable or numerous opponents. Enemies hidden by Mantellum's powers didn't provoke Lung's ability, even if he could see them.

Anticipating a fight, Lung could build up a charge to accelerate the rate of his transformation. He could feel the scales and heat building up inside him. When he was on the brink of transforming, his eyes glowed orange and scales stood out under his skin like hives.

## Pyrokinesis
Lung could create flame out of thin air, shape it, intensify it, and so on. This ability became stronger as he transformed. His flames didn't require fuel, and may not have consumed oxygen. He could create a small flame in his hand and hold it, or hurl fireballs through the air.

His power was partially inhibited by tranquilizers, damp, and cold. Even under their effects, without transforming, he was still able to heat a metal strip white-hot. He could light a flame in his hands without transforming.

Early in a fight, with only a portion of his body covered in armor, he was able to fire jets of fire into the sky and create localized explosions that burned everyone around him. By the time he was a foot taller, he was capable of keeping himself constantly on fire. He could throw out rolling waves of flame. He could curve and shape the pillars of flame he sent out towards targets, or shape existing flames into curving pillars and spears which resisted attempts to extinguish them with telekinesis. He could extinguish patches of his flames if he wished.

Past a certain point, his fires were hot enough to weaken anyone near them who wasn't resistant to fire. With his body fully inhuman, he could cause all fire across a wide area to swell dramatically. Victoria Dallon speculated that he would reach the point where he could take on Goddess and her army singlehanded shortly after.

When he was fifteen feet tall, his fire was blue-yellow and hot enough to soften steel. At sixteen or seventeen feet tall, his "explosion" was ten times as large and hot as before. He was able to disrupt Sundancer's attempts to form her miniature sun, and create a huge torrent of flame large enough to hide his form and engulf her.  Shortly past this point, Victoria Dallon and Lung himself estimated that he was singlehandedly the equal of Goddess and her combined army.

When he was thirty feet tall, his power resembled Sundancer's, being more like plasma than fire, and melted sand on contact. At the most extreme end of his transformation, when he was larger than Leviathan, he burned so hot that the steel-like flesh just beneath Leviathan’s skin was blackening and charring to ash by proximity alone.

Lung was immune to his own fire, and possibly resistant to fire generally, but this wasn't widely known. However, even combined with his superhuman stamina, this didn't fully protect him from the intense heat produced by Sundancer's power.

## Healing
Lung could heal almost any injury, given time, provided it didn't kill him outright. It would take him about a month to regrow a limb. By the time he was sixteen feet tall, he could shrug off a spear through his heart. His eyes had partly grown back by the time he was tried, taking over a week to heal. His flesh would decompose without a connection to his brain.

When fighting Leviathan, he rapidly recovered from a blow from the Endbringer that shattered bones and organs, even though he wasn't yet strong enough to hurt the Endbringer. By the time he was half the size of the monster - that is, fifteen feet tall - he was able to trade blows with it, not hitting as hard as Leviathan but recovering faster than the endbringer did.

Lung's healing made him resistant, but not totally immune, to toxins. This makes medical care, including dosage, difficult as medicine needs to be calibrated to account for his healing abilities.  His system can still be "overloaded" if he overdosed with drugs, overwhelming his healing abilities by forcing them to focus entirely on fighting off the poison. This allowed Skitter's poisons to do more damage than they usually would while he was fighting off tinker tranquilizers administered by Armsmaster.

## Senses
By the time he had grown a foot taller, Lung had significantly enhanced hearing,  and like his other attributes it scaled as he transformed. This aspect of his powers was not widely known to the public, but was known to New Wave.
