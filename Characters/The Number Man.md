# The Number Man
Number Man's ability makes him "good with numbers", to a ridiculous degree with numerous applications.  He perceives his power as elaborate mathematical notations that exist in the air and objects around himself, as if being written in thread-thin lines. He is able to mentally digest the numbers so quickly to the point where his own perceptions and self seem to go in slow-motion.

This power allows him to understand and manipulate the world economy in immense detail. He can also use it to predict the likely casualties of various End of the World scenarios and potentially identify abstract targets, cultural and economic, to push the world toward collapse.

He can intuitively analyze architecture, letting him design buildings, predict collapses, and conduct controlled demolitions. Doctor Mother claimed that he was able to calculate the odds of success for a given Cauldron vial, but this was a lie. Tattletale believed that he would be able to break Dragon's time-lock encryption.

He can accurately perceive things not easily seen by the normal eye, such as the Custodian's presence and the edges of Doormaker portals. He was able to target Night Hag and Nyx despite their visual distorting powers, fight with his sight blocked by bugs, and was able to detect Taylor's bugs and identify people hiding among her swarm-clones.

His calculations help him to survive dangerous falls, though he is still somewhat worried by them.

He can climb building-faces as fast as running on horizontal terrain, using his power to find handholds and footholds. He climbed down a ladder so fast he almost seemed to be falling.

His power is also formidable in combat, using his own body very efficiently. He can analyze and predict an opponent during combat, allowing him to dodge their attacks by extremely narrow margins once he understands their power. He claimed that he could see the stress points of his opponent and strike vulnerable areas to shatter bones. He was able to lock Lung and Bitch's Dogs in holds that didn't allow their muscles any leverage and judo-throw Dragon's Teeth officers in full power-armor. However, he isn't quite as good in a brawl as Contessa.

He is more effective based on how much of his surroundings he can take in before engaging, making the power even better at range than in a melee fight. He once ricocheted bullets to knock the knife out of Imp's hand when she held it to Doctor Mother's throat, and could target Rime regardless of cover and her attempts to dodge. A clone of him was able to disable one of Bitch's dogs by throwing something at it. He was able to track Scion's location for String Theory. His power enabled a clone of him to dodge Foil's attacks, despite her superhuman sense of trajectories and timing. He could also anticipate and avoid Golem's smallest, fastest hands, as well as Revel's programmed orbs.

## Equipment
His power grants him facility with using common objects as weapons, he's seen using his pens in combat, as well as firearms. Using a small pistol he would fire from the hip; on at least one occasion he made use of a sniper rifle.

He was often seen with a laptop. His office contained a number of touchscreen computers hooked up to a Doormaker portal, providing him with info from around the world.
