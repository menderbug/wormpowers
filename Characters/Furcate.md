# Furcate
Furcate is a specialized duplicator that can create one to three instances of herself, who each act independently of the others. They have slightly different personalities and physical differences that can provide other benefits based on the separation. A minor drawback is an imperfect memory, accurate in the broad strokes but she can mess up with some details. They seem to have some degree of shared awareness.

When separated the Furcates need to decide who 'stays' and who 'goes', possibly meaning they draw down on their reserves for remaining separated and not choosing a possible Furcate to 'substantiate'.

## Tactics
Very fond of flanking with the person she trusts implicitly.
