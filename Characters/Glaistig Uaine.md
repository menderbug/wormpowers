## Death Touch and Collection
If desired, Ciara can collect imprints of parahumans using a touch-based ability on their body, killing the person in the process. On one occasion, she killed a mercenary by touching the crystal shell he enclosed around himself right before he could escape.

Ciara can also seemingly collect imprints of parahumans who die within a unknown range of her, as she was shown to have had Bakuda and Grue in her collection despite not being in their immediate vicinity around the time of their deaths to touch them. However, she can avoid collecting a nearby deceased parahuman. It is implied by Ms. Yamada that Ciara had the ability to steal powers even before her second trigger, so what the exact changes to her power were before and after her second trigger are unknown.

## Control of Parahuman Shadows
At any one time, she can have the parahumans she has ‘claimed’ manifest as ghostly specters, complete with the ability to physically affect the world and use their powers; she normally limits herself to two or three, but can maintain more than that at the cost of significantly reduced individual power. They are seemingly limited to her immediate presence, and she can create multiple copies of a ghost through a duplicator ghost. She made twenty to thirty copies of a ghost, and later created multiple copies of Grey Boy.

Capes she manifests appear as  duplicates of their former selves with exaggerated, caricatured or blended features. Their powers are unaltered. They slowly regenerated after being destroyed or injured in a fight. They appear transparent and shadowy but otherwise solid and can interact normally with the physical world; projections that are dismissed dissolve into smoke or shadow or collapse into a point in her hand "like an explosion in reverse". They were affected normally by gravity unless she levitated them with another power.

When they try to speak, their voices sound faint and incoherent to others, as if were emulating language rather than actually uttering it, they can speak in voices only Ciara can understand, although later shadows are able to speak coherently enough to be understood by bystanders. Ciara can communicate with currently inactive spirits and partially aware of their emotions and desires. The shadows maintain their original personality and some degree of agency, although it somewhat wears off with time in the same way as their appearance. The recently collected imprints are even able to defy Ciara's wishes, although she expect them to submit later.

She draws power from her dormant shards, and feeds her active projections with that power. Even when they are not visible, she still has three projections "active".

By the end of Worm, she has absorbed the powers of countless capes, including Eidolon. With Eidolon's ghost increasing the number of powers she can wield at once from three to five, and several more if Eidolon's powers are weaken by him using too many powers or Ciara summoning too many phantoms, she is now indisputably the most powerful parahuman in existence. Even before his death, Eidolon himself speculated that she had grown to surpass him in power. However, as of Ward, she seems reluctant to use Eidolon, stating his "battery is almost empty", and that recharging it would be "more trouble than it was worth". She was able to escape Khepri's control by forcing her to control one of her spirits instead of herself, possibly using that spirit's power.

## Power Vision
Ciara possesses a secondary Thinker power, much like Chevalier and Ingenue, that allows her to recognize the carriers of other shards and see phantom images surrounding the empowered, but it is way more sensitive, including ability to sense distant parahumans through walls and at great distances.  She is capable of recognizing the details of how individual powers work by analyzing their phantoms.

## Vulnerabilities
Ciara is unable to personally use the powers of collected capes. By default, she is a baseline human who still needs food, rest, and sleep: she lacks enhanced reflexes and durability. Thus, it is possible for opponents such as Skadi to ambush and then hit her before she can react. To temporarily augment her own personal capabilities (e.g., enhanced movement, poison gas immunity), Ciara must use power-granting shadows in her collection. Although she can heal her own injuries by using a Healer shadow as of 2015, this granted regeneration takes time and leaves her a sitting duck.

She could not engage Mama Mathers and her group, presumably because Mama Mathers would affect her power vision and any senses from her shadows that perceived her. Without outside interference, Jack Slash's secondary power prevents her from killing him.

She has to collect capes to amass power; Eidolon at his prime dwarfed her in power. Even during Gold Morning, Ciara believed Eidolon was stronger than her.

Capes that she resurrects with the help of Bonesaw and Nilbog are no longer in her collection. To mitigate this loss of power, those resurrected agree to provide Ciara their assistance as members of her flock.

## Titan Valkyrie
As a Titan, she can now spawn a much greater number of ghosts at once and have them leave her immediate presence, with the limit on both being unknown.

## Shard
Ciara's powers are the result of receiving a crippled shard from Scion. She call her shard the Keeper of the Dead. According to Ciara, her shard's duties are at the end of the cycle, which explains why her shard is more patient and relaxed than the typical shard.

Behind the scenes, the Keeper of the Dead utilizes the shard network to make her powers work. Whenever Ciara collects a cape, her shard co-opts their specific local network and makes it subordinate: it rips out an entire package and makes it a shadow that she can load/unload. Clones of a collected cape can still reconnect with their specific local network, though (e.g., Gray Boy).

Thanks to Ciara's second trigger, her powers are relatively unbounded and are thus more leashed to the goodwill of her shard than others. For example, when starting out as Valkyrie, she found herself warring with the Keeper of the Dead over no longer using her power vision exclusively.
