# Fleur
Fleur could create telekinetically controlled 'orbs' of light that looked like flowers or firecrackers. She could plant these orbs with a touch on surfaces, allowing them to grow over time for larger and more varied effects when Fleur detonates them or an opponent accidentally touches them.

Her power needed her hands free to use.
