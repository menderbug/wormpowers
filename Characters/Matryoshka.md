# Matryoshka
Matryoshka can turn herself into a mess of ribbons, when inactive she has a humanoid form with horizontal lines across her body. When absorbing an individual, some of their memories and appearance are absorbed into her costing some of her own. This effect can be repeated, but holding on to anyone too long ‘digests’ them. This can lead to the obfuscation of her personality as more memories and experiences are added to her own, shifting her.

She showcased the ability to hold people in suspension without absorbing them.
