# Ratcatcher
Can see small detached objects regardless of the obstacles between her. She is not able to sense internal objects but she is able to see small things whether animate or inanimate.

Like Hellhound, she keeps trained animals, in her case rats. She seems to have trained or commanded her rats to retrieve the objects that she found, and further says she can get her rats to open doors for her, in another. She could probably maintain an awareness of them while they were out of reach. This may be why she says that rats can "talk" to her.

Following the shift in powers she is able to scrutinize minute details of people, able to see the Parahuman Plague as it stole it's way to it's hosts.
