# Sere
Sere has the ability to violently draw in moisture from his environment, allowing him to stun or kill his targets. This ability ignored forcefields and armor. This limited hydrokinesis, which is conversely not Manton-limited, is effectively targeted dehydration. It is highly dangerous to Skitter's swarm, which he is meant to be a counter to.

Sere can use his power in a long tight cone-shaped "blast" or in a tight field around him. The moisture he extracts remains floating around him.
