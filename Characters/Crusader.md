# Crusader
Crusader had the power to create ghostly duplicates of himself and his possessions that could fly and pass through inorganic objects. These replicas could lift him into the air, giving him a limited form of flight.

He described his replicas as "immune to any strike or bullet, yet fully capable of pushing a man down the stairs or strangling them". They were favourably Manton-limited, allowing them to pass through inorganic matter only; they could impale a person through armor or walls with their spears, and Skitter's bugs couldn't pass through them.

He was "dimly" aware of the actions of his duplicates, and direct them mentally, although they appeared to operate with some degree of autonomy. Taylor speculated that they were "infused with fragments of his ego".

His clones appeared overlapping with his body, and he was able to create a clone and leave it overlapping him, using its flight to lift himself into the air.
