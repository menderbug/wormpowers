# Spitfire
Spitfire has the ability to spew geysers of a napalm-like liquid chemical from her mouth that ignites on contact with objects (not air), creating intense flame that can melt concrete, stone, and steel beams.

She does not have a Manton-protection against heat like most pyrokinetics, since the liquid she spits is inert until it makes contact with someone/something. The fireproof suit and mask she wears is ostensibly to protect her from the effects of her liquid igniting (heat) or dripping onto her body after use. 

She has grown proficient with its use.
