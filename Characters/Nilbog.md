# Nilbog
Jamie has the power to create minions that are customized with feelings and powers of their own. He does this by recycling pre-existing living material. His monsters have the ability to breed and give birth to more monsters, coming in a variety of shapes and forms. This earns him an S-Class rating under the PRT Operations Manual as he is a "high level duplicator ... who operate[s at an] exponential degree" with his creations having their own fantastic abilities.

As Nilbog, he is only limited in the amount of living matter he has to manipulate and shape. He converts this living matter from a target by enclosing them in one of his generated sacs. The target could fight free if able to, but otherwise once enclosed the targets biological material is converted into a 'slurry' as Nilbog transfers them through his body into another sac where the slurries component parts can now be used or can be converted.

To create anything he has to work with something. If the target can move, they can fight free of the enclosing sac. Once enclosed, this is only happens if they have some ability to escape being passed though his body as their flesh is transformed into one of his creatures.

His creations form from his hands in placenta like sacs before he releases them. However, his monsters only have a lifespan of around three to four years, combined with isolation from any new sources of protein which leads to their life span decreasing with each successive regeneration.

He maintains a clairvoyant awareness of all of his creations and can rapidly distinguish between his children and any impostors, including detailed  information about them. Further his creations have their own volition, though they will follow their creator's orders.
