# Titan Oberon
Titan Oberon has the enhanced abilities of both Prancer and Moose.

It is noted to have extreme speed and agility, and capable of leaping a mile and a half in a single bound.

It also is extremely durable, capable of tanking multiple attacks from both capes and other Titans, and slowly regenerate. The accumulated damage, however, still has an impact on his mobility.

Oberon can infuse inanimate objects caught in his shockwaves with breaker-effects. Doing so causes the debris to float, which Oberon can then use as cover or projectiles.
