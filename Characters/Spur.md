# Spur
Spur is a thinker whose precognition functions best when everyone around him is at their worst; FUBAR, in the midst of chaos and heightened emotions. He doesn't appear to be a powerful pre-cog, but is competent cold reader, bluffer and more even without his powers boosted.

His association with Blowout is probably intentional, as both their powers react to heightened emotions allowing for power synergy. This and the above may be what really made him able to operate in the Thinker heavy environment of Las Vegas.

Spur possibly has an enhanced memory, as he is able to remember all of Canary's songs as well as the lyrics, when even she claimed to have trouble recalling them. It's possible that he is genuinely that big of a fan of her work but his manipulative behaviour makes that hard authenticate.
