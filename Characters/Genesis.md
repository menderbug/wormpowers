# Genesis
Jesse's power is tied to sleep and activity. When she wakes up after being asleep she has no 'charge' with which to summon her construct. She must remain awake for a while to "recharge" her ability.

To actually create and summon her construct she has to fall asleep, creating a new body and controlling it while her own body sleeps. The new bodies can take many forms and possess powers of their own, but using her power is easier the more "biologically stable" the body she makes is. Stable in this case means creating a form that could reasonably exist, with functional biological functions and similar, forms outside of real world biology, while more useful, are consequently weaker.

Once she activates her power, she has a set amount of time to visualize the form she wants to use, complete with any organs or mechanisms to allow for special abilities. Failure to include vital organs means her power will drain her reserves, while other forms may lack the ability to move properly if she doesn't pay attention to limbs and the like. It takes her at least two minutes to produce a new form. Her creations faded when she woke up. The time lag from switching over forms means that if the situation changes fast enough she can come to a conflict with the wrong tools, impacting her usefulness at times.

A "triceratops-bull-cyborg thing" that could charge through doors.

A "lady knight in shining armor" that could handle men with guns.

An eight-foot-tall muscular figure like a gargoyle, demon or dragon, with four talons, pebble-like scales, and a short tail. Flies using broad bat wings sprouting from the shoulders. It could breathe out dark smoke that caused coughing even if invisible traces of it were inhaled.

A normal-looking girl with auburn hair, freckles, and thick glasses.

Lovechild of a scorpion and a stegosaurus, armored with a powerfull metasoma topped with a dangerous thagomizer.

A "blend between a slug and a rabbit." Two bulbous eyes, two tentacles or floppy ears and a body that hugged the ground. Water flowed up and to the sides of the slug, and small mouth jetted streams of it at the fires of a building near her. Used for firefighting.

A "crude rendering of a man" used to carry her real body.

A form similar to Bitch's dogs, used as a mount for Trickster and Regent.

A grotesquely obese, yellow-skinned "caricature of a sumo wrestler", with eyes like black buttons, translucent and oily skin, and no hair, clothes, or other features. Items pressed into the belly or put into the mouth became trapped inside, but can be hauled out.

A griffon/pterodactyl with both arms and wings, capable of hitting Crawler with a car and dropping large pieces of rubble on him. No legs, face is "gargoyle-like".

A ghostly woman wreathed with chains, with white, "smoky" hair that covered her face and talons for hands. She has no lower body extending from the tattered poncho-style cloak she wore, and floated as though she were as light as air. Strong enough to shatter plywood.

A giant womanâ€™s face carved out of bone, surrounded by long, thin, branching tentacles. Tough, good for multitasking.

A creature "like a bison with wings, but her back has a bowl-shaped depression, and she has stubby little legs and antennae." Able to fly and carry Trickster in the basin on her back.

A giant image of Eden.
