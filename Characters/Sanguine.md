# Sanguine
Sanguine has a blood-like power of unknown functionality. When seen in the Battle against Leviathan, he is among the contingent that could hurt the Endbringer but not withstand its blows in turn.

One of its side benefits allowed him to function as a healer of sorts with a blood control power. He could draw blood out of people, do something to it - Taylor speculated he is cleaning it - and put it back in. He could create enormous blood clots the size of fists to cover people's wounds.
