Richard had the ability to generate from nothing, blades of varying design formed of metal, then impart velocity to them. Theoretically, he could make them hover by using the velocity imparting ability to counter gravity.

Limits on his power are unknown, presumed to be limited by: radius of control, line of sight, Manton Effect, personal ability to multi-task, and ability to visualize desired design of 'blade' intended. Material limits might be pure metal, specific alloys, other limitations, might not be able to impart velocity beyond specific limits, or a limited number of 'adjustments'.
