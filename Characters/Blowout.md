# Blowout
Blowout has telekinetically assisted strength. His strength and durability increased with the size of his audience and the reaction he got from them. His secondary power fed the same reactions that fueled his strength to leave his targets stunned, reacting slower, or making them take longer to pick themselves off the ground.

This effect is believed to be able to cause more permanent brain damage.
