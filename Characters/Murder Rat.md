# Murder Rat
Being a composite of Mouse Protector and Ravager, Murder Rat possesses both their powers blended into one. She has the ability to inflict gradually worsening wounds, the ability to teleport to anyone she wounds, and various minor powers that grant enhanced strength, reflexes, and agility, as well as enhanced senses, flexibility and toughened skin.

When she cuts someone with her blades, the wounds begin fizzing and emitting smoke. Murder Rat can then teleport to these wounds, appearing within the smoke, which blooms outward like a smoke grenade prior to materializing.

The wounds that Murder Rat inflicts widen over time, even after Murder Rat's death, and can be devastating if left untreated. They take a long time to heal and almost guarantee a permanent scar.

When Grue copied the powers of a trio of Murder Rats, he mentioned that he could sense what others sensed around him.
