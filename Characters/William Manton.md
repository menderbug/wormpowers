# William Manton
Manton is intelligent, highly observant and a trained scientist, specializing in Parahumans and their abilities.

In a throes of grief and guilt from ruining his daughters life by giving her a vial, Manton imbibed one for himself.

After taking the Cauldron vial, Manton is able to project an image of his daughter, though naked and striped in black and white, hence her name - the Siberian.

The Siberian can ignore natural forces as she sees fit, and is effectively invulnerable. She is also able to project this invulnerability to other people by being in physical contact with them, though she is not able to make Manton himself invulnerable.

There are several other limitations. It likely takes concentrated mental effort from Manton to be able to use the Siberian. His power has a range limit on the projection that is at least 1000 feet. Tattletale suspected he could stay miles away and still manage some control over the Siberian, but stayed close by (such as when he is within range of Grue's second trigger darkness) for voyeuristic purposes or improved control and faster response times. Presumably, Manton cannot alter or change the Siberian. Whether he can maintain the projection while he is asleep is not known.
