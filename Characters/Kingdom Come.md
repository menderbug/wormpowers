# Kingdom Come
Kingdom Come is a Breaker, able to vibrate and self-explode, showering those nearby with gore- more than should be contained in a human body. This explosion has enough force behind it to crack nearby windows.

Kingdom Come then gains control over anyone covered in the bodyâ€™s material. He can control everyone under his influence simultaneously. Controlled subjects do not speak with their original voice; rather, Kingdom Come communicates through them, possibly with his or a mixture of his and the subjects voices.

Apparently he reforms his body by separating it from the last unreleased victim. It can be partially prevented by restraining him.

If his minions die, he can survive, but suffers some unspecified personality damage, a common problem with breakers.

His victims have a barely existing, dream-like recollection of periods under his control.
