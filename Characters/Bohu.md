# Bohu
Like all Endbringers, Bohu is extremely durable and can regenerate quickly thanks to her Endbringer physiology. As mentioned above, she can alter her size by absorbing the surrounding terrain. It takes time to spread her Endbringer qualities to the absorbed material.

Bohu's primary power is large-scale manipulation of the surrounding terrain and architecture; this power's effective radius spreads over time as long as she remains stationary.  She is unable to affect material Annex is merged into and affecting. Her manipulation of the environment usually follows a strict pattern:

Between each of these phases, Bohu will generate spikes that spring out from architectural features. Her spikes are sharp and fast enough to pierce Weaver's reinforced spider-silk armour.Â She sometimes feigns an inability to use her spikes.

During Gold Morning, she displayed the ability to reshape defenses to protect her allies.

Bohu appears to perceive the world by sensing tremors. Like other Endbringers, Bohu cannot be predicted easily with the typical Thinker danger sense and is also a blind spot to the typical precognition, including Contessa.
