# Citrine
Citrine's power allows her to "attune areas to particular functions", altering specific properties within a relatively small area.

She can interfere with gravity, temperature variation, friction, light intensity, and the progression of time, among others. She claimed that there were "more possibilities than I could count, many so minor you wouldn't notice." She could use her power to make everything within her ability's range effectively waterproof as an example.

Most notably, Citrine can "find the right attunement, as though I were searching a radio station" to neutralize a given parahuman's abilities. Furthermore, she can specifically cancel out protective powers, or cause powers to go out of control. This latter effect never takes more than twenty or thirty seconds. She risked striking the wrong attunement and accidentally killing her target. Further, some powers are too subtle to find out in time before she is retaliated against, or have the subject step out of her range.

Citrine's power gives everything in its area of effect a washed out yellow effect as if the observer was colorblind, only able to see yellow. Under the influence of the Yàngbǎn, it appeared as a golden glow.
