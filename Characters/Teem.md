# Teem
Teem has a Master ability that allows him to create a veritable tide of low-grade minions. He can produce thousands at a time, and they can range from the size of a quarter to the size of a bear. The pure mass of them is able to give even Titan a pause.

Teem can also fly. He uses it to pour his minions on targets.
