# The Slug
The Slug is a monstrous cape who can brainwash people. He erased the memories of Case 53s, and also is, likely, able to transfer knowledge of languages to his subjects. Wildbow speculates that the Slug is responsible for setting up the Nemesis weakpoints for their Nemesis program.

## Power Removal
As a possible countermeasure for clients that reneged on their deal with Cauldron, Doctor Mother claims they have an in-house cape that can allow them to remove powers if necessary. Wildbow speculates her claim is real because of the Slug: as an example, he can choose to edit the brain of an affected individual so that a spoken key word or phrase will permanently or temporarily remove their powers.

Wildbow speculates that Cauldron can set up this countermeasure by subtly asking a client to check in with the Slug. However, he also speculates that this countermeasure is only set up for certain capes that they were not sure they could trust (e.g., those without enough pre-existing strings to pull), or if a client later proves to be surprisingly uncooperative/untrustworthy. Indeed, it would probably be too taxing for the Slug to hit all Cauldron capes with this process. Cauldron is presumably unable to use the Slug against Mama Mathers because of her power.
