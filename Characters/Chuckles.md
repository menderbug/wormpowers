# Chuckles
Chuckles is a Brute and Mover. He has super speed in his head and legs and super strength in his chest and arms. Unfortunately, Chuckles' powers cause him to perceive the world around him in perpetual slow motion, leaving him unable to communicate. He taught himself how to make a sound similar to laughter - the source of his name.

The original Chuckles may have had greater versatility with his abilities with developed tactics that were not displayed by his clones.
