# Ashley Stillons II
Her powers are largely unchanged, and her random firing issues are taken care of as long as her prosthetic hands are maintained. This means the previous enhancements that she has were refined and miniaturized to give her greater control.

In a fight she is extremely energetic, and can propel herself wherever she wants thanks to her Blaster ability. This forward moving combat approach makes her very hard to predict thanks to her head to head nature and the chaotic expression of her power.

She is acknowledged to have a high degree of control, and is able to use her warp blasts to erase small items. This control, partially a function of her prosthetic limbs, is unavailable to her predecessor. When they are damaged she has to deal with the same issues her predecessor has. Agitation causes her power effect to play along her fingers.

Ashley is immune to her sisters power just as she is immune to her own. Her power expression is different from her sisters in subtle ways. Notably, it sounds slightly different.

She still has some old residual body enhancements that do not require maintenance, making her more resilient than average.
