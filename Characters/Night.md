# Night
Dorothy can transform into a horrifying monster when unseen. This is summed up by Tattletale as an inversion of the Manton Effect, a psychological block to prevent others from seeing her true form, though she admits that this explanation was incorrect. Whenever Night reverts back to her human form she is instantly healed, effectively 'resetting' any damage she takes and restoring her to a "pristine" state.

## Breaker State
Dorothy's monster form has inhuman speed, strength, and durability from the nigh-invincible exterior of an amorphous "ink blot" body that is paradoxically composed of sharp edges and has many long, insect-like legs that end in claws. Taylor described her as a "multi-legged, hyper-agile, lightning quick death blender of blades and claws".

These angular legs do not have proper joints, but can bend and stretch and turn inside out as it moves around. This allows Night to avoid being tripped. Her body was seemingly covered in some sort of oily lubricant.

Based on the admittedly inexpert opinion of Taylor, this form does not have any identifiable sensory organs analogous to sight or hearing. This does not seem to impede her, however. A lack of oxygen and high pressure does not seem to impede Night's Breaker state, as she stayed completely underwater, out of sight, guarding the meeting place where the Brockton Bay parahumans gathered to discuss the arrival of a new S-Class threat to Brockton Bay.. This raises questions concerning the amount of time Night can stay in her alternate state.

Dorothy's monstrous form has horrendous strength and speed, with more than enough to incapacitate any of Bitch's dogs, shattering their protective bone plating. Although her blades left cuts wider than Taylor's handspan. Night is able to achieve high speeds in this form, but is able to make sharp turns unhindered by momentum and navigate obstructing obstacles easily. It was so fast that Taylor briefly thought she had teleported.

It is unclear if her transformation is psychological or physical; Skitter's swarm-sense does not trigger the effect, only conventional sight.

## Power Classifications
Night and Fog's PRT classifications are given in Sentinel 9.1 as "a Breaker 9" and "a Shifter 8 with Stranger 3", but it is unclear in the chapter which rating refers to which character. Later comments by the author have indicated that Fog was the Breaker, and that he has since changed his mind and would now consider Night the Breaker and Fog either a Breaker or Changer.
