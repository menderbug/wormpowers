# Assault
Ethan is a kinetic energy manipulator, controlling the energies of movement, acceleration, and motion, but only on himself and things he touches.

Battery is able to kick off him and leap in the opposite direction at full power without hurting him; in fact, he could use the energy of the impact to move himself at high speeds. He could move over long distances at speeds similar to Chariot, whose suit allowed him to move a hundred miles an hour. He could cross a room with a single leap. He couldn't hit as hard or move as fast as Battery could when charged, but he moved faster than she did on average.
He has a limited ability to resist incoming containment foam, which slid off him more easily than normal. Bugs slid off him as if oiled.

He could deliver kicks that shoved a person across a room without hurting them. He could kick a desk into the air across a room at an enemy.

As Madcap, he used his extremely flexible power somewhat differently.
He could hit an armored van hard enough to make it roll, or stand in front of one and have it bounce off him, crumpled as if hitting a telephone pole. He could rip the doors off an armored van. He could rip a weapon from an enemy's hand or smash them against the ground with a touch. He could smash his way through a solid concrete wall without slowing. When Battery slammed him against a wall, he rebounded as if made of rubber. He is able to throw her down the length of a hallway. When he ran, he moved faster with every step. He could make a metal chair that is tripping him crumple and explode.
His power didn't prevent him from stumbling on unanticipated objects, nor make him immune to Legend's kinetic lasers. His power is totally ineffective when he is in midair.
