# Relay
Relay is a Mover who can teleport towards a certain person, with his arrival teleporting them in turn. This move manifests as a shimmer of light.

He is also a Thinker, who can communicate with people via 'telepathy'. This is limited through concepts. The language interpretation is by the recipients brain, presumably meaning it is not restricted to the individuals language. However it is unknown how he is 'thought' back at: he claims he is able to 'read' Victoria but this is not elaborated on, with Crystalclear using a walkie talkie to communicate directly with him. This part of his power can be used for long-distance communication.
