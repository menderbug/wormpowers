# Othello
Othello possesses a 'mirror self' or 'imaginary friend' that travels in another world, and only has limited interactions with reality. It must move around to gather intelligence, its passage does not disturb anything in the normal world as someone who is invisible or even intangible might. However it can not walk through walls or similar as it occupies its own mirror world that reflects wherever Othello is.

He can shunt himself into the mirror world, bringing his other self in from that world at the same time â€” producing an effect that could be mistaken for teleportation. He can control the nature of the interactions between his 'mirror self' and the world, allowing it to attack while remaining otherwise invisible and intangible, making shallow cuts and similar to targets. This ability required concentration.

The sensory input he receives from his companion is resistant to Imp's power, and may apply to other similar powers as well.
