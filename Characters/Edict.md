# Edict
Edict can give one-word commands to any single target within earshot. If the commands are actions that take three seconds or less, failure to obey causes a variety of consequences, while if the commands cannot be done that quickly, they can be canceled out by starting the action.

Failure to obey Edict's commands can cause colorblindness, hiccups, sneezing fits, tics, mutism, a temporary wound, falling, clumsiness, a disabled limb, paranoia, hallucinations, confusion, amnesia, blindness, mental deficits, general malaise, a trigger event or power flaw, mental grief, minor stroke-like symptoms, hallucinations, amnesia, compulsive tics, etc. The form of "penalty" is unpredictable.

These effects tend to fade after a few hours, with some notable and tragic exceptions.
