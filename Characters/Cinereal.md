# Cinereal


Cinereal is noted for her raw power and durability.

Cinereal creates large amounts of particulate "ash" across an area, spreading it with waves and blasts as well as creating plumes from her body when struck or striking during combat. The sticky ash seeps into and strengthens nearby structures. Her power is thus more effective when she remained in one location. Once the ash is created, she has no ability to move it, but can absorb it into herself or ignite it (see below.)

Cinereal can absorb and coat herself in the ash, consuming it in order to teleport and/or heal herself (which automatically kicks in if she is mortally injured.) Once she has activated this breaker state, she is unable to leave the area of ash until she has used up all the ash in the area, in a time-consuming process that heals any injuries she took during the battle. When she exits her breaker state, any nearby flames are simultaneously extinguished.

As a leader she has always has a reputation for being a talent scout.

## 
Cinereal has another ability that she almost never uses - she can set herself and the nearby ash on fire, causing it to burn at 1100 degrees C and consuming it at a steady rate.




The Ashen Titan gained a massive increase in range, in addition she now converts inorganic matter inside her range into the ash, and can fully control and shape the ash.
