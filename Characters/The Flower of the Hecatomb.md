# The Flower of the Hecatomb
Hecatomb is a Brute, capable of taking immense damage. When she is damaged, a new version of herself will rip out of her damaged body. This new version is larger and stronger than her normal form. She is strong enough to take on a direct attack from a Titan or parry it.
