# Sleeper
From an out-of-universe perspective, relatively little is known about his power. However, Sleeper deserves his reputation: he does not have a Stranger power to be inherently viewed as a dangerous S-Class threat. During Gold Morning, Khepri declines to capture him while collecting parahumans to use against Scion, believing him to be "more trouble than he is worth".

## Storm
His power manifests as a 'storm' that from a distance crackled, boiled, and popped. The storm looks like a cloud of rainbow shimmers; according to Defiant, the rainbow sheen somehow felt nonsensical with the way the colors unfolded. Sleeper's storm appears to move relatively slowly; it crept forward at the horizon when the Wardens lured Sleeper to the City. Defiant describes the storm as being Sleeper: this could possibly imply Sleeper has a Breaker power where the awake state is the storm and the dormant state is humanoid. The storm is large enough to hang over one part of the City while Sleeper is present in the area.

During Gold Morning, Sleeper went through the Zayin portal while refugees were still setting up the settlements at Earth Zayin and the storm swept over them. Although Sleeper's storm did not cover a large area, it still swelled in size to be large enough to encapsulate the portal, every nearby settlement, and most of its fleeing inhabitants. The storm disrupts communications in the affected area; by settling near the portal, he blocked the refugees who escaped the area from getting back via the portal.

When the Simurgh is flung into Sleeper's storm, she is trapped, lay prone, and is taken out of the picture entirely. She is still dealt with even after he retreated from the area. Wildbow mentioned the following hypothetical capes would be 'goners' trying to survive and escape Sleeper:

The Wardens has specific countermeasures in mind and looked for capes with any of the following to go up against Sleeper:

Torso could counter and defeat Sleeper, given the ability to reach him. When Sleeper started to emerge at one point after the Attack on Teacher, Legend leveled around 30 km of city in an unknown timeframe to cause him to go dormant again.

Wildbow noted that a hypothetical Shaker capable of transforming the atoms of any solid within 200 m into a crystal-like organization and slowly spreading this crystal effect through connected solids would have a very slim chance of surviving against Sleeper despite being Manton limited against herself and biological matter. This crystal-like matter is chemically inert, extremely heat-resistant, durable, and electrically-and-heat-conductive. However, her odds are still so poor that it would take a miracle for her to survive.

Based on the countermeasures and capes effective against Sleeper, some speculations can be made. The storm likely appears to be capable of devastating anyone inside unless they have All-or-Nothing defense, can physically keep taking on different forms, or have a special enough brain. His power might be fueled by some forms of matter or is related to some form of matter subversion/creation, as Legend leveling areas of city could deter Sleeper and the hypothetical Shaker has a very slim chance of survival. Destructive attacks that are All-or-Nothing are likely effective against the storm itself.

## Other Abilities
Sleeper is a blind spot to the typical Thinker precognition. However, he is not on the list of blind spots for Contessa as of the Attack on Teacher; Titan Fortuna created a path that involved Sleeper. He is not a blind spot for the Clairvoyant.
