# Unter
Unters presumably has powers similar to Ãœber, possibly with some variations. One Unter is able to throw knives with exceptional prowess, managing to hit Young Buck with kitchen knives unweighted for throwing as he flew by. He is also able to hit Chronicler in the arm with a thrown knife even while being blinded and attacked by Skitter's bugs.
