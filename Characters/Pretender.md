# Pretender
Pretender has the ability to take over the bodies of others, with their powers still intact. He could not take over corpses.

When he took over Alexandria, his dark pink eye could be seen in her empty eye socket, where her own eye is missing. Her existing eye looked normal.

It is unknown if Pretender can possess one of Satyrical's duplicates. If he can then it opens up many possibilities for their relationship.
