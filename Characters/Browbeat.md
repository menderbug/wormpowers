# Browbeat
Browbeat has two powers - short-range telekinesis and biokinesis; his abilities are mutually reinforcing. Further in the face of a Power cancelling Trump that affects one aspect of his powers the other half would generally need a separate counter.

## Telekinesis
His telekinesis is a personal force field with some crude control, having a multiplicative effect on his physical strength. While also having a noticeable defensive aspect, given that he is theoretically durable enough to survive damage from Leviathan, and could have survived the Battle against Echidna.

This also justifies his striker rating.

## Biokinesis
His physical strength is bolstered by his biokinesis, as he makes himself into a physical Adonis. He can patch up his own wounds and harden tissues, accumulate calcium into stone-like plates under his skin. He can use his biokinesis to reshape his features, possibly qualifying him for a Changer rating. He could return to his natural state reflexively, drastically reduces his muscle mass towards the original baseline.

As he gained more familiarity with his powers he could reflexively dampen the damage from burns by creating heat resistant chemicals, neutralize the toxins by isolating it with in the body; increase the insulation and conductivity qualities of his flesh before electricity damage takes hold. He can use his powers to modify his appearance marginally, unable to affect any sort of fine detail change.

Interestingly for a natural trigger Browbeat goes out of his way to avoid conflict, a trait he shares with his parents. The implications this has regarding his relationship with his shard is an issue not addressed.
