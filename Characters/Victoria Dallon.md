# Victoria Dallon
Victoria has the classic Alexandria package of flight, invincibility, and superhuman strength. She also radiates an aura that makes her allies more inclined to respect and look up to her, while making her terrifying and intimidating to her enemies.

Her passenger is a bud from Manpowerand  Brandish, and also pinged off of Gallant.

## Forcefield
Victoria's invincibility and strength is the result of an invisible forcefield that extends a few millimeters over her skin and clothes. She or her passenger subconsciously controls whether others can make skin-to-skin contact with her, though she has gained enough control to suppress her forcefield at will.

It needs to recharge for 1 to 2 seconds after it receives a heavy impact, or after a few seconds of sustained fire (such as a beam or jet of water.) Even a strong punch can be enough to trigger this effect, and it takes longer to recharge after holding off a sustained hit. Her own super-strong punches and kicks cause it to flicker off and revive. This makes for a fragile invulnerability. Dealing with sustained fire causes her shield to take longer to regenerate. It does not consider machine-gun fire to be a single sustained attack, but rather a series of individual blows.

When Victoria first triggered, her forcefield did not protect her clothing. With time, it began to protect her Glory Girl costume as well, although the skirt is only inconsistently protected.

While active, it can block even a direct hit from Scion. The field protects her from the cold and bugs during the flying, but still allows her to feel the wind in her hair.

Certain pockets of air close to the cracks into Shardspace can slice Victoria's forcefield by sending different portions to different realities. The Ripple shaker from the Taught can throw out distortions that could tear her forcefield and continue without stopping, though it leaves her forcefield in tatters. Cradle, at his strongest, can draw silver lines capable of cutting straight through her forcefield without collapsing it. Luckily, if Victoria drops or knocks out her forcefield, her power will recover its original state after it recharges and comes back up. Rain O'Fire Frazier can always do the same as Cradle by drawing a silver line and then activating it; however, if she drops her damaged forcefield, it would take a minute to recharge instead of a bit of time. Note that the Ripple shaker, Cradle, and Rain lack All-or-Nothing powers, which suggests her forcefield is not All-or-Nothing.

All-or-Nothing powers such as Foil's charged objects, blasts from Damsel of Distress, and headbutts from Torso can knock out Victoria's forcefield and continue without stopping.

## Strength
Her strength is primarily generated through the forcefield, and operates through a similar mechanism to Manpower's. She's capable of deadlifting slightly above fourteen tons, however functional limits depend on the grip and the distribution of mass.

She is strong enough to casually launch a man or a metal dumpster over seventy-five feet.

She can impart explosive strength when she throws an object (i.e., a power common to both herself and Manpower) to hurl it faster than what is possible with super strength alone.

## The Wretch
Illustration by Scarfgirl
Following Gold Morning, Victoria's forcefield is stuck to her previous form, before Amy corrected it, causing it to extend beyond the bounds of her body in the shape of her mutated form. She referred to this phantom-memory forcefield as the 'Wretch', since the extended and misaligned forcefield expressed a degree of independence. Victoria has to be mindful about it, so as not to wreck surroundings accidentally. However, in some situations, she is able to position it to protect other people.

After sustaining a big hit, the delays for bringing the Wretch back up will be longer than usual.

Eventually Wretch learns to manipulate objects without instantly destroying them. It is able to arm itself with improvised weapons and guns during the Attack on Teacher's Compound, and later throw objects with a great effect.

After her Journey to the Shardspace, Victoria gained near perfect control of her forcefield. She is able to use it with impressive dexterity, doing things like braiding her hair, carrying a cell phone and picking up a team mate without harming them. She is capable of moving her forcefield independently of herself, adding some rotational power to her arsenal. This can be used as a crude fan in situations involving gas.

When the Firmament is damaged in the fight against the Titans, the shape of her forcefield changed once again, decreasing in 3 times. Now with less arms and legs, her forcefield is at a halfway point between its original form and its full wretch form. She also started getting sensory information through it.

In it's new form, the Wretch has less arms but the remaining arms are closer to each other, better enabling Victoria to move things around. She can use her forcefields fingernails to cut things in combat.

Following the emergency healing from Chris Elman, Victoria loses fine control over the forcefield yet again.

This lack of control does not last long, as she comes to terms with her shard and gains full control over her forcefield. Victoria is now capable of selectively creating arms and mouths and other parts of her forcefield, without being forced to unleash the entire thing at once. By invoking memories of the time that Amy has turned her into a flesh coffin, Victoria is capable of emerging from inside her forcefield and having it act independently of herself. In doing so, she is still capable of using her flight and her aura, but is no longer protected physically.

## Flight
As Glory Girl she could fly at almost 80 mph . She raises that to slight excess of 100  mph as Antares. She is still able to fly even when her forcefield is inactive.

As long as her forcefield is active to protect her, she is capable of flying straight through walls.

One one occasion she is able to survive being accelerated into the blur by Ballistic, it is unspecified which powers assisted her in that, but the situation demonstrates that Victoria can handle acceleration way out of non-lethal range.

Victoria is noted by Crystal as being very good at aerial maneuvering, noting that Victoria can spin around in mid-air without getting dizzy, something she is not capable of. Victoria has used this to her advantage before, notably when taking out Etna, who has similar middle ear issues to Crystal, that make it difficult for her to perform sharp turns in midair. However, she has no meaningful advantage when compared with some breakers.

## Aura
Victoria can radiate an energy that makes anyone within her presence feel an emotional surge of awe and admiration. For those with a reason to be afraid of her (e.g., her foes), it is a feeling of raw intimidation instead. Her aura can bypass cover. It can also affect insects created by the Mother of Mothers.

Victoria's aura is not a true Master power; it is a Shaker/Master power. Victoria's aura does not have long-lasting effects; it is not a factor behind Amy's issues.

She is able to turn this aura off because it is a power that she has to willfully turn on. When turned on, Victoria can dial the power of her aura up and down: its minimum setting is fairly subtle in effect. She can also push out or pull in her aura to control its range (i.e., radius); her maximum range is at least 100 feet. The closer one is to Victoria, the more powerful the effect of her aura. By taking actions that complement the emotional charge, she can also enhance her aura's effect (e.g., breaking a table to better intimidate her foes).

It is possible for one to resist her aura if they understand what they are feeling and put themself in the right headspace, especially if she makes the effect obvious. Some individuals such as Lung, Bitch, Krieg, and Victor process her aura differently and get angrier instead; however, Victoria can use this to provoke them on an emotional level and distract them.

After Gold Morning, Victoria starts trying to be more deliberate with how she uses her aura. For example, she starts using it with physical contact or at point-blank range to more effectively stun her targets.

After the Firmament is damaged, her aura is altered. Instead of forcing people to feel fear or awe, her aura now forces people to feel something akin to interest or attraction to her. Following a revelation during her second visit to the Firmament, Victoria gained the ability to choose what emotion her aura projects, based on her own feelings and memories.

## Emotion Resistance
As Victoria gained her aura by triggering in Gallant's vicinity, her power makes it difficult for him and some other emotion-based parahumans to read or influence her.

## Connection to Shard
Victoria has a very strong connection with her shard, as shown from its own perspective. Her shard has expressed a strong desire to help her achieve anything she would set out to achieve.

Victoria believes that her shard is enforcing her intuition around certain events, in almost a pseudo-Thinker ability.

## Equipment
Gun by Nocturne
Victoria frequently makes use of tech gifted to her by Kenzie, specifically a camera that she can place in her eye that provides her with a HUD.

Later in the story, Victoria is gifted an enormous fourteen ton laser cannon by Dragon. This cannon shoots a golden beam that is capable of damaging Titans and knocking down buildings. It has no appreciable recoil, allowing her to use it alongside her forcefield without her forcefield popping.
