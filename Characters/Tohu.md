# Tohu
## Power Simulation
Tohu's main ability is to simulate the powers and visages of up to three individuals at a time. She appears to manifest her copied powers using the body parts that are copied from the original (e.g. shooting lasers using the hand mimicking Legend). When Tohu simulates a cape, she copies the current capabilities of their powerset; for example, she could summon copies of Glaistig Uaine's shadows when mimicking her. She can even simulate the powers of dead parahumans and parahumans who are half-way around the world.

Tohu needs time to choose her "masks". Weaver believed a fight with the Twins is effectively over once Tohu chose all three masks and Bohu claimed the battlefield. Weaver speculated that the limited time for defenders served as a counter to Scion, who often arrived too late.

Sustaining heavy body injuries can still reduce Tohu's combat effectiveness, forcing her to spend power to regenerate and recover. Scion did so much damage to her on Earth Gimel that she is left too broken to fight.

## Manton Limit
As a non-sandbagging Tohu clearly did not use masks of Scion, Eden, and the other Endbringers when fighting against Scion, she is Manton-limited to parahumans. Her mask choices also imply an inability to choose a specific mask more than once at a time (e.g., Tohu did not use three masks of Glaistig Uaine simultaneously).

## Known Powersets
## Other Abilities
Despite her small size, Tohu has incredible durability and can regenerate thanks to her Endbringer physiology. She appears to perceive the world by sensing power expressions. Like other Endbringers, Tohu cannot be predicted easily with the typical Thinker danger sense and is also a blind spot to the typical precognition, including Contessa.
