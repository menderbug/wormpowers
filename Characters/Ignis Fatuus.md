# Ignis Fatuus
Ignus Fatuus displayed a "flickering" ability much likeÂ Scapegoat's, which he used to conjure costumes and tools for himself and Apocrypha, as well as to heal injuries and free himself from bindings. His flickering seemed to be limited to one body part at a time, limiting both his healing and his ability to escape from restraints. His other power is aerokinesis, which allowed him to create vacuums, make sounds carry, and fly. The range of his aerokinesis is approximately three-quarters of Skitter's bug-controlling range. Eidolon speculated that Ignis Fatuus wasn't affected by Eidolon's slow loss of power. Skitter, however, speculated that Ignis Fatuus is enhancing his power using his variant of Scapegoat's ability, shifting through various possible states until he reached a desired state at full power. It is unknown whether either of these are true.
