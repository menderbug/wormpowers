# Mannequin
Mannequin's ability is described as a "tinker who specialized in sustaining life, sheltering it from outside forces; forces that included water, weather, space… and bugs." After the death of his children and wife, he changed from trying to protect others to "using his power to help and protect himself and himself only." The modifications he performed on himself separated him from his humanity forever, inside ceramics and systems that would keep him a mockery of life for millennia.

As a tinker, Mannequin can retain the benefits of his technology even if his powers are suppressed, but he grows noticeably less coordinated using it. His entire makeup allows him to operate easily in especially hostile environments. The mechanical nature of Mannequin's movement effectively makes him tireless as long as the systems hold out.

Due to being mostly modular, his fighting style is never quite the same twice, and his flexibility and many weapons give him a lot of options. He used a different configuration with each confrontation, approaching a problem from different angles and rapidly finding out how to defeat his opponents.
