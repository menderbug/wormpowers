# Horizon
Horizon has three types of enhanced senses.  She can use only one at a time.

Horizon's primary offensive power is an explosive touch linked to perception. Her striker ability is somehow linked to the quality and quantity of her focus on a target.  It has ranged from delivering blows at five or so times the usual strength to obliterating large vehicles. The variance in effectiveness sometimes drastically changes from one moment to the next. Furthermore, the more open area behind her target, the more she can let loose.

As a complement to her advanced senses Horizon has learned to lipread with accuracy.
