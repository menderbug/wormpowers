# Scion
After sacrificing the majority of his shards to seek out hosts, Scion retains only his most essential shards. Even so, he has a vast array of powers that allow him to take on pretty much any threat and is considered the most powerful individual in the world. Scion is capable of easily killing even the Endbringers if he puts his mind to it, and is practically invulnerable to all forms of attack.

## Stilling
Scion's primary ability is the power to negate any kind of wavelength using manifestations of golden light. This effect is extremely versatile; among its uses are the cancellation of heat and sound, the disintegration of molecular bonds, slowing or stopping motion, negating the effects of virtually any parahuman ability, and disruption of electronics. At its deadliest, Scion's "stilling" can simply stop all bodily functions in a human, essentially killing them instantly. Scion's light can be fired as beams, orbs, or area bursts, and can be used as a force field or transmitted by touch; essentially, he can shape his light into any form he wishes. All of Scion's "stilling" effects are completely silent, including his movements and his attacks.

Thus Scion's offensive blasts can range greatly in power, from pencil-thin cutting beams to continent-destroying blasts. He has practically infinite range as he can shoot across oceans; his blasts can track targets by curving in mid-air. The detrimental effects of Scion's light lingers, continuing to eat away at any damaged targets. This lingering effect can kill a man all on its own. Scion can also use his power defensively, using it to create physical barriers or cancel out the effects of offensive powers. His stilling can also close portals and even stop the Simurgh's song. Finally, Scion's light can have healing abilities, such as when Scion cures a man of cancer or when he uses his light to heal the capes around him upon his arrival in the battle against Behemoth.

## Flight
Scion can fly at immense speeds as an application of his aura of golden light. At his fastest, he is able to fly to the other side of the world in less than a minute. When flying, he leaves a brief golden trail in the air.

## Senses
Scion can sense everything around him, even when his senses are being deliberately obfuscated. He appears to have control over the range of his senses, and can see into other universes if he chooses. He can also use the senses of parahumans, since they carry his shards.

To deter Scion from tracing their activities, Cauldron scattered around deviants in their headquarters and on Earth Bet to act as a kind of smokescreen against Scion. Deviants were an asset to Cauldron as Scion would instinctively turn away from them. As Scion is a blind spot to Contessa, she used deviants as distractions to help constrain him.

## Super Strength
Scion has superhuman strength, sufficient to lift Behemoth several hundred feet into the air.

## Regeneration
Scion's body is only an extension of a vastly larger being, and so cannot sustain any meaningful damage. Any damaged tissue is replaced within a fraction of a second with a practically unlimited supply of undamaged tissue from the main body. This happens so fast, it is almost impossible to tell that he is ever injured. This is an intentional design of Scion's body, one meant to demoralize his opponents.

If his body is hit by certain powers such as Foil, it will turn him into a portal that leaves his main body vulnerable to a more devastating follow-up. Many other powers with an interdimensional component exist that can do the same as Foil and the Subway Cluster.

## Power Cancellation
Scion is immune, or can make himself immune, to multiple parahuman abilities with exceptions for "perfect" abilities. His actions cannot be predicted by Precognitives (future sight) or clairvoyance (far seeing or remote viewing), his powers are not subject to most trump interference, and he is immune to emotion-affecting powers. In addition, his multiple senses make him very difficult to blind or mislead for any period of time.

With stilling, Scion can "tune" his defenses to negate specific powers. He destroyed some of Glaistig Uaine's shadows to such a degree that they were still mending six months after Gold Morning. He can block teleportation.

## Precognition
Scion can look forward in time to observe countless possible futures. He can learn what actions he must take to achieve a specific future or goal, similar to Contessa. Unlike Contessa, he can use this power in any situation, but it drains from his lifespan, so he uses it sparingly.

Khepri believed that although his use of precognition lacked imagination compared with Contessa's, he set up contingencies to automatically dodge physical threats such as Foil's charged projectiles. However, he has no contingencies against psychological threats; humanity employed a successful and effective short-term psychological warfare campaign to bully him to death.

## Dimensional Travel
Scion can freely move through alternate universes, doing it as easily as a human might walk. Barriers preventing travel between universes can be broken down by Scion in seconds. If necessary, he can attack objects in multiple universes simultaneously, such as obliterating cliff faces on two different Earths.

Scapegoat claimed the multiverse is infinitely branching; he believed a seemingly infinite number of Earth Bet realities are branching off the main Earth Bet reality since it diverged from Earth Aleph. According to Scapegoat, when Scion's blasts devastated Earth Bet, his blasts also devastated every other Earth Bet that branched off this main Earth Bet reality.

## Other Abilities
Scion has a handful of other powers such as radiating his emotions to nearby individuals and thinker abilities to understand languages and cultures, and a long list of other powers that aren't described in-story.
