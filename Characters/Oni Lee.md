# Oni Lee
Oni Lee's power is a hybrid between teleportation and duplication. When Oni Lee teleports, he leaves his original body behind which can act autonomously for five to ten seconds before disintegrating into a cloud of white carbon ash. Essentially, he can create another version of himself anywhere within his line of sight, while the old version can stick around long enough to distract or attack his target. He can not teleport to anywhere he cannot see, It is unknown if his own carbon smoke gets in the way of his teleporting.

Oni Lee has used this duplicative teleportation to act as a immortal suicide bomber , to swarm opponents, and create smokescreens. The downside to this ability is that, when he teleports, he also clones anything that is on his body. This allowed Skitter to track him after directing her insects to bite and sting him as they were teleported alongside him.

Aside from an offhand remark by Jack Slash, there is no evidence that his power causes brain damage or mental degradation. Given that no other powers in Worm cause brain damage to their users, and when Bonesaw later checked Lee's brain she only found damage from his brush with death , Jack's words may simply have been hurt pride rather than Lee's actual power mechanics.
