# Sidepiece
She can tear any piece of her midsection off and use it as a destructive projectile. Her 'ammo' is dependent on the amount she can tear from her stomach and how quickly she can tear the tissue away. Anything in her lower torso is fair game, bones, skins, organs, everything. Regeneration rates and effects are dependent on the tissue type, they no not seem to follow the law of conversion of mass as when they detonate there is far more of an explosion then there is any reason to be giving the starting material.

On an extra note, any material that is knocked off of other people by an explosive effect of one of her organs is set on fire, in a similar way to the parts that came from her.

Sidepiece also has slightly enhanced strength from her elbows down, making tearing her own flesh easy. it also helps her with her throwing, which she is very experienced with. Tearing organs off aren't enough to prime them for detonation she needs to activate them and then throw the individual organ. She has removed several organs to make a pile for later use, though they later set off.

## Equipment
With her consistently concave midsection she can store items without interrupting her profile.
