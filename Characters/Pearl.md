# Pearl
Pearl manifests an aura of repulsiveness so strong the relief of having it lifted can be addictive. She capitalizes on this by making herself and her territory as disgusting as possible this makes it easier for her power to amplify feelings of disgust to full repulsion and reinforce her reputation as a crazy person.

Her power's secondary effects help her cope psychologically with her rough circumstances. Further she may have resistance to emotional manipulation by other capes.

## Tactics
She has constructed strategic squalor to shield a palatial lair where she can benefit from her slave trading. When needed she will bring in mercenaries that can function with her in some way.
