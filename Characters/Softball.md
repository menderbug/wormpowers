# Softball
Softball has the ability to create spheres of light around living things, which moved to follow them. Anything inside the sphere of light became soft and malleable, and any alterations to it while inside were permanent.

When Taylor's bugs caught inside the bubbles tried to move in different directions, they were squashed against the edges as if against a solid surface, but made it through. When one surrounded her head, she has difficulty breathing and her vision is distorted, but went back to normal when the effect ended.

The spheres were only large enough to contain someone's head at their largest, and faded after a short time.
