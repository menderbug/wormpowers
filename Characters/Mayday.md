# Mayday
Mayday is an artillery-type blaster who summons large red spheres composed of 'abstract energy' filaments from far behind him that he can then direct towards a targeted area. Where the energy impacts, a major, yet discriminatory, rearrangement ensues. Targets can be pulled to their feet or knocked down, they may end up facing another way, be placed behind cover, innumerable changes are possible at the impact site. Mayday himself is either immune or can be easily excepted from this rule, as can any friends and allies. On a smaller scale, he can shoot small blasts of the energy to push targets back, and presumably he can fall back on these when he can't set up a artillery strike.

His energy balls, roughly the size of a trailer home, are summoned through various hand gestures and are accompanied by a black flare when they appear. Starting as orbs the energy deforms as it moves through the air, perhaps deforming in the air resistance, forcing it to stretch.

His power is highly disruptive to enemy tactics and can destroy other constructs, but it is not that powerful. Non-targeted individuals just feel a wash of warm air as the effect touches them.
