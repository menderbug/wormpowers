# Etna
Etna has the ability to create globs of superheated glass. She usually lobs these during battle. These globs can splash upon impact increasing her combat potential.

She has also showcased the ability to float in a heat bubble, and an unskilled level of flight. Victoria compares her maneuverability to that of a bomber aircraft.

Later, she switched to using a glass spear.
