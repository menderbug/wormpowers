# Revel
Revel has displayed the ability to manipulate and capture diverse forms of energy with her lantern and then use that energy to launch orbs at her enemies. The more energy she collects,the greater the charge she has for her orbs, which are roughly a foot across and deep each, and can follow complex flight patterns that she sets along with specific detonations. She can also reprogram these orbs after they have been launched, and can decide whether they damage allied targets or not.

This allows her to survive lighting blasts from Behemoth, though she is blown back far enough that she received a head injury.

Revel also has the ability to fly.
