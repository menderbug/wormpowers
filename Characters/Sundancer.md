Marissa's power allows her to create a miniature sun, hundreds or thousands of degrees in temperature that she can manipulate at will, even while the orb is out of sight. It is bright enough to leave spots in the vision of anyone who looks at it, even for a second.

The orbs she could create ranged from the size of a beach ball, to a room, to the size of a three-story building, but even small orbs are dangerous. One the size of a beach ball is capable of forcing a fifteen-foot-tall Lung to collapse from the heat. It took time to form the sun, with repeated flickers of flame appearing between her hands. When sufficiently transformed, Lung's pyrokinesis is at the level to prevent her attempts to form the orb, it could also be disrupted by hand but this ran the risk of being exposed to its heat.

Over time she showcased more versatility with her sun, using it to put out fire by flash burning oxygen and absorbing heat and flame into her sun, or creating a small light. Her orb is able to burn creations of the world's foremost tinker, even through doors meant to keep out Endbringers. Her control of the Sun is such that it responded to her will even when it is out of her sight.

Temperature completely normalizes close to her, as part of the protections afforded by her powers, preventing her from getting burned. This effect extends to her clothes and the ground beneath her for about five feet. It doesn't extinguish flames but prevents them from damaging anything.
