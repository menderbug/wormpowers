# The Pharmacist
The Pharmacist is a pyrokinetic with the ability to manifest purple flames from her hands. She could also manually increase the intensity of the fires she created, and extinguish them at will. However, she could only extinguish fires that she could see.

The Pharmacist's flames ignite nearby active powers, spreading across them like normal fire across oil. For example, this effect applies to Breaker forms, Shaker effects, and even Master effects such as Goddess's alignment. The Pharmacist's flames also ignored power-based invulnerability.

Although the purple fires do not appear to chase after Thinker powers, they can blind them (e.g., Goddess's danger sense) or be painful to perceive (e.g., Crystalclear's vision).
