# Hatchet Face
Hatchet Face is a parahuman with superhuman strength and enhanced durability, as well as the ability to nullify the powers of parahumans nearby. This combination made him a highly efficient cape-killer, as any close-quarters battle between him and another parahuman essentially turned into a fight between a regular human and a Brute.

His durability has been stated to allow him to survive being run over by a steamroller, observed evidence has a clone being tossed by the head over several blocks and standing up unscathed and barely noticing attempts to cut his throat. His strength allowed him to move incredibly fast for his frame and allowed him to swing his namesake hatchet through a car if need be.

His aura instantly nullified the power of anyone inside it.

Hatchet Face is vulnerable to attacks and ability effects from outside the range of his powers, as Cherish used to her advantage during her induction into the nine. Tinkers were largely unaffected, mainly losing the instinctual use of their technology that their power provides. He cannot revert the effects of Browbeat's biokinesis alterations; Browbeat could still trade blows with him.
