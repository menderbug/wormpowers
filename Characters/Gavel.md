# Gavel
Gavel's defensive potential is extremely high, to the point that Wildbow refers to him as someone who can't be killed. His power makes it so he can only take so much damage at a time, and reduced the severity of any damage to a set amount. As such, shooting him with a hail of bullets would be little different from shooting him with one or two bullets, and any given bullet would only gouge out a teaspoon's worth of flesh. Gavel's defense is strong enough to take hits from Scion, lasting for one or two minutes against him.

That said, Gavel's power is not without weak points: he is relatively vulnerable to beam attacks, as a steady stream of attacks could whittle him down, and he can be taken down by attacks that ignore defenses, such as Flechette's.

Offensively, Gavel has the ability to lift objects three to four times his own weight, and to imbue melee weapons with both his durability and with vast impact, strong enough to knock down Scion into a fifteen feet long furrow. He can also transfer his defensive power from his weapon to his target, making the target near-invulnerable as it flies through the air. The target will then be pulverized when it hits something else. Gavel can choose not to imbue the target when hitting them, simply killing them instead.

Taylor compares Gavel's power to that of Excalibur's scabbard, which provides King Arthur with protection from blood loss and severe wounds while he wears it.
