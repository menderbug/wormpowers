# Adamant
A ferrokinetic, Adamant is a heavy hitter good at staying in the fight because he can apply his power in a Brute-like fashion.

## Crude Metallokinesis
He can broadly manipulate metal around himself with strong crude movements (e.g., pushing, pulling, crushing) for both offensive and defensive purposes. To create equipment for personal use, Adamant can gather metal and reshape it into large rough weapons (e.g., greatswords, mauls, axes). He can then use his metallokinesis to augment his ability to slam targets with these weapons at moderate strength.

To serve as protection, he can form nearby metal into crude armor around himself. Not only does his metallokinesis allow him to wear this armor without being encumbered, but he can also hinder opponents that use metal weapons or armor against him in close quarters because Adamant can potentially disturb their footing or shove aside their attacks before they land. His armor is durable enough to go toe-to-toe with Hellhound's augmented dogs.

Adamant can use his metallokinesis to distort his armor into a variety of useful shapes, such as a blade to cut through restrictive material. When confronting Skitter, he distorted his armor to create a completely form-fitting suit that allowed him to wade him through her swarm (albeit being mostly blind). On top of his ability to reshape metal, he can also slowly refine it to enhance its strength and durability, and also repair damaged armor.

## Drawbacks
His metallokinesis focuses on strength instead of agility/accuracy: it lacks fine control, has short range, and is slow.

If Adamant reshapes his armor so that it fully covers him, his peripheral vision suffers accordingly.

His armor is still heavy for others: Adamant specifically needs a retooled PRT motorcycle that can handle his weight.
