# Acidbath
A formidable Breaker/Changer-class cape, Acidbath is able to turn himself into a form consisting of clear, highly acidic liquid, strong enough to cause Scion to smoke, roughly five times his original mass. In this form, Acidbath is able to move as a tidal wave, reaching speeds greater than that of a typical car. He can reactively turn himself to acid before an attack makes contact, negating some or all damage and splashing those nearby. Acidbath is capable of partial transformations, slinging punches with his hands becoming projectiles, and can fire acidic blasts within a hundred feet range.

Acidbath himself is immune to his own acid power and caustic chemicals, even resisting burns in general, although this protection does not extend to his gear.
