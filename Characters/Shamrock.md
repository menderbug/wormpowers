# Shamrock
Shamrock possesses a subtle combination of microtelekinesis and similarly small-scale unconscious clairvoyance/precognition that gives her the ability to "affect small changes to create wider effects, essentially altering events in her vicinity". Her power makes her seem exceptionally lucky. For example, she can fire bullets that hit exactly where they need to, land on ice without slipping, and barely dodge attacks such as Scrub's blasts and a section of wall thrown by Trainwreck. More mundanely, it can be used to influence the results of numerous coin flips and dice rolls, and to collect lost or scattered items. Because she is a Cauldron cape, it is highly likely that this power is specifically constructed to be such.

Faultline claimed precognition wouldn't work with Shamrock's power in play; However Shamrock is not a blind spot for Contessa; whose precognition abilities are Perfect. When Contessa gave her final warning to Faultline's Crew, she defeated Shamrock without being touched once. It is unknown how Shamrock's power would affect individuals such as Dinah or the Simurgh.

The Number Man confirmed Shamrock could not be located by the Clairvoyant.
