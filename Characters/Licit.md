# Licit
Licit could create forcefields in geometric shapes, remaining aware of them to an almost clairvoyant level. He could individually choose what could pass through his forcefields, he can walk through his own forcefields easily. Sufficiently powerful hits could shatter the fields.

While he is potent defensively and strategically, his low range and lack of offensive applications hinder him, as his forcefields often appeared in shapes like pyramids, diamonds, cubes, spheres, and cylinders. He can turn some of these shapes into sharp points by manipulating how these shapes are expressed.

The range within which he can create forcefields is listed as either line-of-sight or twenty feet.

He has a relatively low power rating, Whether this is due to his powers' lack of effectiveness or his own lack of creativity is unknown.
