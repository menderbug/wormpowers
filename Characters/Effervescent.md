# Effervescent
Effervescent could manipulate emotions, specializing in incapacitating people. Like Gallant and The Heartbroken she could read emotions, able to do crowds of people and very far away.

She can read people's emotions en masse and at significant range being trusted with patrolling at the Portals. she is refined to the point she could also act as lie detector.

Effervescent is unable to get a consistent read on Victoria or Mr. Drowsing, likely due to their own master powers. This likely means she would have issues with other Emotional manipulators as well.
