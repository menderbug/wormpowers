# Mama Mathers
With the potential to be an S-class threat, Mama Mathers' exceptional power gives the Fallen some protection against PRT intervention and singlehandedly allows her branch to form whole communities while still eluding the authorities.

## Primary Ability
For lack of a better term, her power effectively gives her "quantum tripwires" that trigger in response to any sense that perceives her. When a tripwire is triggered, she establishes a connection to the offending sense and infects the subject with a "fragment" of herself: this fragment immediately manifests itself and stays until a short time after Mama Mathers is no longer being perceived. While a fragment is manifested, Mama Mathers can do the following:

The potency of an infection (e.g., strength of effect, degree of control over that sense, infection duration) depends on how long and clearly the sense perceived her. Indeed, if a subject gets more exposure to her, it strengthens the connection and gives her more of a foothold. For example, people who only fleetingly register her in some way are still affected if only nominally, though this can still be enough to play tricks and distract people. With more exposure, she can cause powerful and disabling hallucinations.
She can even carry on whole conversations without needing to speak. Note that if a subject heard her voice but has not yet talked to her actual self, she can strengthen the connection if they talk back at her.

She can create an ad-hoc communication network between those she has affected.

## Connection Multitasking and Awareness
Mama Mathers can feel a connection to every subject that is currently infected. Each subject has their own fragment which all have a separate instance of her attention. Behind the scenes, Mama Mathers' shard presumably handles this multitasking so that she, as an example, can independently control hundreds of thousands of fragments simultaneously without issue.

## Fragment Remanifestation
For even the most basic of connections, if an infected subject later refers to Mama Mathers by name with the infected sense (e.g., saying or writing her name), this action invokes her fragment and allows Mama Mathers to remanifest her fragment for some time. The stronger this connection, the more easily the fragment will remanifest. For example, if a subject gets more exposure to her, then this fragment can remanifest if they think about her or refer to her in abstract.

As a reward for good behavior, Mama Mathers can choose to have a fragment remanifest itself in limited ways when invoked (e.g., Rain for an evening only heard the sound of wings when he thought of her) and not share what it perceives with herself.

## Affecting Esoteric Senses
Mama Mathers' "quantum tripwires" also apply for any senses derived from powers. Her power acts as a harsh anti-Thinker ability that allows her to keep her kin covered from snooping eyes. The effect of her power is more intense if you use enhanced perception powers on her.

Even technology can trigger these tripwires. For example, a fragment manifested itself as a "ghost in the machine" when Lookout's flying camera perceived Mama Mathers.

## Other Abilities
According to Rain, Mama Mathers monitored the Crowley clan for years, twenty-four seven: she presumably does not need to sleep. She is also immune to standard tranquilizers, though the Wardens did find a way to sedate her.

## Vulnerabilities
Her connection to an infected sense is not permanent and will slowly degrade and weaken over time if a subject has not recently perceived her. All manifested fragments also feel what Mama Mathers is currently feeling. For example, when Victoria Dallon, who does not have an emotion sense, got close enough for her aura to extend through some hostages to a hidden Mama Mathers, Mama Mathers affected the hostages in turn. The hostages' brief change in screaming gave away her location to Victoria.

Infected subjects are unable to transfer their infection to other subjects (e.g., a non-infected individual that sees her in the video feed of an infected camera will not be infected).

The Graeae could swap body parts out so that if someone perceived Mama Mathers with a body part (i.e. eyes, ears), Mama Mathers is only able to establish a connection to that body part's original owner. When outside shardspace, Mama Mathers, despite her connections, is unable to apply her power on Rain while he is in the dream room.

Hallucinations do not persist while Mama Mathers is unconscious.

Chasmal could partially phase Mama Mathers out of reality. According to Tattletale, that should break her connections as long as it lasts and is maintained. It could even possibly force her to reset all connections.
