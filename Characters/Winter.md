# Winter
Winter's power did not involve cold generation as her name implied rather it is a dampening effect that caused bullets to lose their inertia, heat to seep out of areas, energy attacks to lose their fizzle, and humans to lose their will. She could likely concentrate her power in a smaller area, halting all motion, based on what is seen with a hybrid clone. Even at its widest and least intense, it reduced ambient temperatures to the point that moisture froze in the air creating a telltale mist. When it is somewhat concentrated, the effect is strong enough to kill Weaver's bugs in seconds.

People under its effect experienced a mental torpor, feeling their thoughts slow to a crawl. They would stand still as they died from cold. This made her a highly effective hostage taker, and a good teammate to Crimson when he needed victims.

The original Winter may have has even greater facility with her power then what is displayed by her clones in the The Slaughterhouse Nine-Thousand. She is able contain a precinct replete with heroes in her original incarnation.
