# Queen of Swords
Queen of Swords is a high-level Trump. She can create and manipulate lines of light that connect her to the capes in the area, as well as extract a translucent blob from that diagram. Bullets shot into the blob gain the effects of the powers that the diagram connected, and were able to make Scion stumble.
