# Hoyden
Hoyden is a cape with multiple powers. As a striker, anything she hits will explode, while an attacker would also suffer a retaliatory explosion should she be hit. This is in combination with a resistance to damage from other powers, one that becomes better the further the distance from her target. Combined with basic strength and durability increases, classifies her as a brute. This let her survive things like falls from great heights; indirect force could still affect her though.

Combined, these powers allowed her to take lightning strikes from Behemoth and fight hand-to-hand with Scion. She also has some resistance to mind effecting powers.

Her power is under conscious control, she could suppress it.
