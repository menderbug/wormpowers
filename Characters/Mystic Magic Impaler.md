# Mystic Magic Impaler
Mystic Magic Impaler has an ability that worked through her weapons. She has some sort of spacial warping spear extension, which varied based on whether she is swinging it, thrusting it, or keeping it still.

As a Titan, the Impaler has the same abilities but significantly scaled up and with a changer-flare. She can use her space warping through her praying mantis-like limbs, and is powerful enough to deflect beams from Legend, and easily smear an Alexandria Package cape into a paste. There seems to be no range limit to her power anymore. She uses space warping effects to move in unintuitive ways, using her lances as fixed rotation points.
