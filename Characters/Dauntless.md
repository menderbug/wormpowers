# Dauntless


Dauntless can empower items by infusing them with a little bit of power each day, permanently enhancing them. He wields a spear, shield, and boots; all enhanced with this ability (see below). It is widely suspected that he would eventually equal or even surpass the Triumvirate, but no one is certain if his power would eventually level off.

Dauntless is constantly "charged" with energy, which builds up over time; every 20-30 hours it reaches a peak, allowing him to dump the excess charge into an object. This does not take as long to build up if his power is used often, and if he is engaged in field work. His power is more effective if he charges the same object regularly; he compromises by focusing on three or four and cycling between them. When he dumps the charge into an object, it is briefly supercharged for a few minutes before levelling off at a point better than before.

He selects what the imbuement does subconsciously; it is always tied to the object itself, and he is never surprised to learn what it does, but there is a bias towards direct combat applications. Objects gain general durability and physics-immunity at first, and then begin to gain other abilities after the 20th charge. It took around a month for him to develop a new power to the point where it would impact a confrontation.

His items cannot be used by someone without this "charge", preventing them from being stolen or used against him.

Had he survived until Gold Morning, he would have been almost as powerful as Legend. Not as mobile or versatile at range, but fast and an artillery powerhouse, and almost as durable as Alexandria. It is implied that he could eventually grow powerful enough to annihilate a large area, similar to a nuclear bomb.

## Arclance
A spear that looks as if it is made of white lightning. The weapon could extend as far as he needed, elongating faster than the eye could follow. It is something between a solid and an energy, combining traits of both; people struck by it experienced a taser-like electrical charge in addition to the physical force.

During the Battle at the Gallery, it is too weak to noticeably affect Bitch's dogs. Taylor likened it to using a taser on an elephant. However, it is strong enough to accidentally shatter glass.

It is durable enough to parry a block from Circus' sledgehammer.

Kid Win based his spark pistol, which shot "hard electricity", on data Armsmaster collected on the "hard light" used by Dauntless and Purity.

## Shield
His shield, fixed to his left forearm, is a metal disc about the size of a dinner plate, surrounded by rings of the same energy that made up the spear.

It could widen into a bubble-shaped forcefield of white energy ten feet wide around him. The field is seemingly able to "eat away" at Grue's darkness in some fashion. It made a loud sizzling, crackling sound. The field created a painful arc of electricity when it brushed against Regent's hand.

He is able to raise it fast enough to deflect Circus' thrown knives. It "popped" when Ballistic used his power to smash cars into it so fast they were impossible to see, but not before stopping the car and holding it aloft long enough for it to roll off the top.

## Boots
His empowered boots made his feet look as if they were encased in white crackling energy when worn. They allowed him to fly. According to Tattletale, they made him fast enough to follow Purity while flying, faster than any of the other Brockton Bay Wards or Protectorate except Velocity.

## Armor
Dauntless wore gold and white armour. It is rumored that he has enhanced his armor with his power, but this wasn't visibly evident. In reality, only "some" of his armour has recieved "a few" charges of his power, but it wasn't a major focus. Immediately prior to fighting Leviathan, he charged the breastplate, which granted him a small amount of extra durability.

He is briefly stunned when Grue landed full force on his helmet. When Circus hit him in the chest with their sledgehammer, he is seemingly knocked unconscious.

Wildbow has stated that he could eventually have become almost as durable as Alexandria, possibly reflecting the ultimate potential of the armor.

## Helmet
Dauntless wore a gold Greek-style helmet, with slits for the eyes, a band of metal covering his nose, a slit running down over his mouth, and a metal "mohawk" on top.




After being thrown into the time bubble by Leviathan, Dauntless gained about 90 days worth of power in the span of a few seconds as time rapidly passed outside the bubble. In a panic, he pushed all of this power into his helmet. Doing so caused his thoughts to dramatically slow down. As such, despite the fact that his body is trapped in stopped time, his mind is moving at the same rate as the outside world.

Over the next few days, Dauntless pushed more and more power into his helmet. This expanded his awareness beyond the bubble, allowing him to see and hear everything going on in the area around him.

After four years, the bubble is popped by March, and Dauntless immediately has a broken second trigger. This resulted in every single item of clothing that he has pushed power into, gaining this power all at once. Dauntless grew to the size of a skyscraper, tall enough for his head to be in the clouds. His entire body crystallised.

This giant version of Dauntless appears to exist in every known universe. He is able to see everything in every dimension with the power of his helm.
