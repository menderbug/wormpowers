# Nyx
Nyx has the ability to release poisonous gas from the vents on her body which she forms into solid shapes that move at her will. If she chooses to release it or you break the shape it releases the gas. At best the gas will knock a person out, at worst it can cause permanent brain damage and organ failure. She also seems limited in how much gas she can produce. Presumably she has some form of Manton Effect that protects her from the effect of her power but this is unconfirmed.

A young instance of her was adroit enough with her gas to create illusions inside of illusions. The original Nyx was likely more skilled and may have had a stronger connection to her passenger. Another could overlay disguises on others, with the illusions mimicking what the covered individual was doing.
