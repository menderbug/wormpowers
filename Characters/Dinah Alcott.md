# Dinah Alcott
Dinah has the ability to see the likelihood of something occurring in the future, which her power resolves into a percentage chance. She does this by perceiving trillions of possible universes and sorting them into groups based on a single event.

At Coil's insistence, Dinah also demonstrated the ability to pick out a single timeline and interpret it, which is used to see a future where Crawler did not kill her, Coil, and the Travelers. It allowed them to find a situation where they could escape and then employ it.

If someone asks Dinah a question, she does not have to answer that question. However, she instinctively looks at assorted futures in response to a question. For this reason, she appreciates it if other people can avoid phrasing things as questions. If Dinah lies about an answer provided by her power, it messes up her power for a while after, likely because actions relating to this answer affect the results.

Over time, Dinah could ask more questions per day. When Coil revealed Dinah to the Undersiders, he initially wanted her to answer six questions. On the day Crawler visited Coil's base, Dinah asked around 15 questions. About two years later, after saving her power for the Slaughterhouse Fight in Los Angeles, Dinah is able to ask around 36 questions that day. After the Attack on Teacher, she mentioned how she could ask 40 to 50 questions per day.

## Blind Spots
Scion recoded Dinah's shard with strict limitations before directing it to her. Thus, she cannot accurately see past the Entities themselves, the Endbringers, shardspace, and other blind spots to the typical Thinker precognition (i.e., Eidolon, Sleeper, Valkyrie, and Pastor). Dinah also cannot see a trigger event directly.

Dinah's precognition is not All-or-Nothing; other precognitives can interfere with her power. Indeed, Contessa and other precognitives and situ change Thinkers are blind spots.

Shard-derived sensory powers cannot perceive Mantellum (i.e., he blinds shards); he and anyone in his radius are presumably a blind spot as even Contessa cannot perceive him with her All-or-Nothing power.

Although Dinah has limited sight past the point of interaction with a blind spot, she can work around them to some extent by seeing everything around them as well as the immediate future right behind their point of influence. Thus, she is better at seeing past blind spots than Contessa as long as she asks questions about them. For example, this allowed Dinah to predict Gold Morning, engineer Khepri, and determine that just kicking the Simurgh's ass will suffice.
