# Faultline
Faultline has the ability to separate molecular bonds in any non-living material to make holes or cuts by touching it. she is extremely adroit with her power, able to use it strategically and in concert with others.

It seems that her power does not have a visible effect unless she is using it on things she is Limited to.
