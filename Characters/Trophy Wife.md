# Trophy Wife
Trophy Wife collects pieces of organic life, exclusively animals, including humans. Any body part Trophy Wife has near her gives enhancements in the form of beneficial mutations. 

Those within fifty feet, or roughly fifteen meters, fall within her aura that grants the same mutations at half strength. There is a transition period before the mutations take effect, which takes some getting used to.

## Equipment
