# The Siberian
The Siberian is both an unstoppable force and immovable object. She is one of the few individuals who can theoretically break in and out of the Birdcage.

## Unstoppable Force
Although the Siberian does not possess the ability to delete matter on contact, when moving she can choose to be an unstoppable force that cannot be blocked by any non-perfect defense. She can easily take the shortest, most direct paths by simply pulverizing obstacles (and people) in her way as though they were tissue paper. The Siberian's attacks pierced through Hero's body armor and Alexandria's invulnerability. She slapped aside a projectile dense enough to pull in cars with their gravity.

Attacks from the Siberian are strong enough to take Legend out of a fight. Because of how Scion's regeneration worked, she can intersect his body to constantly damage it.

## Untouchable and Immovable Object
An untouchable and immovable object, the Siberian is unaffected by physical forces or any non-perfect attack. Punches from Alexandria and lasers from Legend did nothing to her. She is immune to both Trickster's teleportation and Panacea's biological manipulation abilities. She can decide what parts of her are affected by which forces, actively allowing her hair to sway in the breeze. The Siberian actively allows gravity to affect her so she can walk; she could ignore gravity powers.

## Property Sharing
With the exception of a certain individual, she is capable of bestowing her invulnerability on anyone or anything she is in physical contact with; this sometimes bestows a similar monochrome effect on them. This allows her to make huge leaps on even the most unstable surfaces by transferring the effect to where she leaps from and then applying it to where she lands. While sprinting and granting invulnerability to two individuals, she can still grant invulnerability to the surface around her feet to prevent it from shattering.

According to the Number Man, she can only grant invulnerability to up to five individuals at once, less if they also intend to move afterward.

## Mobility
The Siberian cannot fly. Although she lacks augmented acceleration and is slower than Movers like Battery or Velocity, the Siberian still has the physical power to move quickly, especially since she can ignore air resistance and minimize inertia. When she attempted to catch Legend, Skitter compared her leaps to an arrow loosed from a bow. She is seen gliding in a few cases to make huge leaps: she can leap across a city block (i.e., 300 feet) in a single bound. The Siberian can travel faster than Bitch's dogs, Crawler, and Shatterbird.

On one occasion, she is in close proximity and on the same road as Tattletale, Trickster, Sundancer, Grue, Skitter, Panacea, Bentley, and Sirius. However, if she lunged for them after Tattletale revealed they knew about her secret, despite the group not yet knowing its location, the Siberian would actually lose this fight as she would not be fast enough to kill them before they found and dealt with her secret.

## Manifestation
Because of her origin, the Siberian can reform in close proximity to a certain individual when destroyed. Even when not destroyed, she can apparently do so at will: this effectively gives her the ability to teleport to that individual.

## Vulnerabilities
Although the Siberian is immune to virtually any parahuman power used directly against her, she is not necessarily immune to external influences. To pin and slow down her movements, Legend blasted the unprotected area around her so that she could only go straight down. While being held hostage, Tecton created a fissure by striking the ground; the Siberian is not immune to gravity at the time and so fell into it. Piggot believed Vista could manipulate the space around the Siberian to help control her movements.

If the Siberian contacts an All-or-Nothing effect, they will nullify each other, causing her to flicker out of existence:

A tuned Stilling attack, such as one from Scion, can also pop her.
