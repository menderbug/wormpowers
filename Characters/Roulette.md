# Roulette
Dez is, in her words, a 'shotgun precog', viewing a number of relatively inaccurate visions.

She views a spread of futures in a matter of moments with the number of events and the length of the viewing periods depending on the time since her last 'shotgun', her emotional state, and her degree of rest. During testing, the number of futures viewed varied from two to six and the duration varied from seconds to hours, respectively. The ability hits a ceiling at the point where she is incapacitated for longer than the visions last.

Capabilities and priorities Roulette observes are reasonably accurate, but events can diverge wildly. Testing conducted proved she has her best return when she is in direct combat. She speculated, based on the occasional vision that featured extreme differences (such as the Moon being a different shape), that her power is observing possible worlds and then extrapolating one possible future of that possible world.

Roulette's power sometimes seemed to actively work against her and her allies' attempts to figure it out, especially if she avoided combat.
