# Amaymon
Amaymon can summon four totems or "diagrams", each with a specific function. They can either be used to suppress a specific parahuman ability or to create some other effect. He can summon them all at once but when he uses one the other three disappear. While the trump effect is suppressing another parahumans power he can not use the effect, the supression effect itself is temporary.

He can redraw the diagrams at will but if he has used them before they will be semi transparent. Slowly fading back in until they are, presumably, back to full strength.

It is unknown how his power effects parahumans whose powers effect the body. He is ineffective against Case 53s.

He can handle his creations, having used the crescent like a sword and presumably can use the others.
