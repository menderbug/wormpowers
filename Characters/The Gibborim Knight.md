# The Gibborim Knight
The Gibborim Knight has abilities similar to Chevalier, but scaled up. He exists in multiple dimensions at once and presumably can affect things that also exist in multiple dimensions like the Machine Army.

His native strength is enough to rip cars and infrastructure apart, with additional abilities letting him create armor and weapons similar to Chevalier by combining these various items together.

Armored up he can take an appreciable amount of hits from Titans, like Dauntless and Hunter.

As an artificial being he is unable to produce or even survive without intercession from his creators.

After being upgraded by Chris, the Gibborim Knight appears to have even more depth with his abilities. It appears he can infuse objects with more abstract properties, as he is seen making a chunk of building into a bomb by swiping it through fire, and enhancing a concrete pole with reality-warping effects by swiping it against a crack in reality.
