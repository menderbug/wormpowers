# Newter
All his bodily fluids (including sweat) contain powerful hallucinogens which can "send someone off to la-la land" in "only a few seconds". When Newter brushed against some of Skitter's bugs they "dropped off the wall or out of the sky, falling to the ground, alive but stunned." Skitter observed that several of the people that Newter were fighting were removed from the fight before he even touched them, leading her to believe that he hit them with either "blood" or "spit". This deviant body chemistry extends to the point that he does not get infections from foreign microbes.

Newter's altered body has other benefits. In addition to a prehensile tail, he is noticeably tougher than a normal human, able to operate with wounds that amazed a trained medic.

Newter is able to leap in excess of 15 feet exceedingly fast (it is said that it takes the same time for him to leap from one opponent to another as it takes SkitterÂ to throw a punch). He appears to move in a half-run half-crawl manner which allows him to move faster than the average person (is easily able to keep up with Brutus when he is larger than a horse). Additionally, his ability to move vertically appears to be exponentially better than the average person as at one point "he darted up the side of the building and slipped into an open window like a bolt of greased lightning" presumably indicating that he has some form of enhanced ability to grip objects (wall-crawling).
