Eric has a power set identical to his mother and older sister - flight, the ability to project hard light blasts, and create forcefields around himself  Though his talents primarily lay in his ability to create forcefields, with his other two powers being relatively weak, e.g. his flight speed is the slowest in the family. However his range is still decent.

His signature shields were a bright blue.

He has shown the ability to shape his forcefields at will and fix their position in midair without any grounding. In addition, his forcefields were strong enough to withstand the full force of one of Leviathan's tidal waves though the effort drained and left him weak. Afterward, he is barely able to fly and create forcefields, his reserves exhausted.
