# Chicken Little
He can see through birds' eyes when he isn't controlling them and, when he is controlling them, the birds go where he 'pushed' and moved away from where he 'pulled'. He cannot control them individually, rather he sets 'invisible flags' or rally points where birds get pulled towards. Alternatively, this can be used to make the influenced birds move in a wave, told to attack targets on their way and similar actions. His control is fine enough to make an individual pigeon hop from one knee to the other, then back again.

He is later seen controlling a flock of birds, and can likely control full flights of such. He gained a large amount of firepower when he is given "Chicken Large".

Aiden triggered with a bud of Taylor's Administrator Shard that allows him to control small simple life forms. In his case, birds.
