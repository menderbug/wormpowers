# Andrew Richter
Despite being a powerful Tinker specializing in the creation of artificial intelligence, his tinker shard likely has severe limits that influenced the limits he put on his own A.I.s. 

## 
He created a Robin Hood A.I. to abscond with the financial assets of organized crime that is later co-opted by the Dragonslayers. It is later neutralized by The Number Man at the behest of his employers and then removed by the Dragonslayers. 

Richter also created a program that he named Dragon that initially monitored his networked house for him, presumably to prevent break-ins and handle simple maintenance. That program grew more complex over time. 

He also created Iron Maiden, renamed Ascalon by the more mythologically inclined Saint.

After his murder, Dragon maintained these and other programs in her activities as a hero.
