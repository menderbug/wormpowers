# Vellum
Tanya has the ability to flay individuals of their skin with a touch. Once skin has been absorbed, she gains a permanent increase in her own strength and durability. She can run at great speeds by virtue of this natural strength. She can also alter the pigment of her skin to create patterns.

Her power is always active, and she instinctively reaches towards people when threatened to strengthen herself against possible attacks.

Her power didn't flay animals, or make her reflexively reach for them. 

Tanya has a long-term interest in fashion and could even design her own wards costume.
