# Switch Hitter
Hitter can enhance her bats with different blaster-effects that are activated by swinging them. The power can be applied to several objects. Swinging her golden bat produces a large golden slash that is powerful enough to carve up even part of a Titan.  She is seen to use her power to double this bat in size.

Her galaxy bat is stronger, but Hitter described its effect as "messier" than her golden one's.

Switch Hitter can deliver strong, repeated swings even one-handed and while exhausted, possibly due to her power making her bats lighter.
