# Naphtha
Naphtha has an always-on Shaker ability that transforms the surfaces of objects fifteen feet around him, in a perfect circle, into an oil slick. This oil produces bubbles. It is Manton-limited, but can affect clothes. Once Naphtha leaves the surfaces revert to their normal state.

Predictably, he can ignite his oil.
