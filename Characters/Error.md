# Error
Error has a Stranger power. The specifics are unclear, but seem to involve inflicting bad luck on both specific targets and in a general area. Attempts to hit her will instead hit teammates, and people will stumble and injure themselves. She likely needs to be able to perceive her targets in order to affect them. She has certain stances that help focus how she spreads her power, along with keeping them in view.

While comparable in effect to Shamrock, the mechanisms of Error's power are different. Error affects her targets via enviroment and can presumably be blocked the same way. Shamrock affects the physical and is unconsciously aided by her precog abilities. Further Error has a much larger area of effect with a lack of fine control.

## Equipment
Error carries nunchucks.
