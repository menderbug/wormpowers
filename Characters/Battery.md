Battery has the ability to charge up her power and then release it to give herself a large boost to her speed, a smaller boost to her strength and some electromagnetic powers. Each second she spent charging gave her several seconds of power usage. She was also almost invincible while charged. While charged, she was faster and stronger than Assault, although he was faster over a long distance because she needed to stop to recharge.

According to interviews and article Taylor had read, it was probably a physiological change, enhancing her biology and then altering it back before the strain becomes too much. She needed to be able to concentrate in order to charge, and she needed to stay still or stick to simple actions while charging. She reached a limit after charging for 7-12 seconds.

Battery was considered a speedster. When charged up, she could run so fast that she was a blur. Time seemed to slow around her, and she was able to dodge streams of containment foam so quickly she was difficult for Taylor to follow with her eyes. Her reactions were good enough that she had no fear of accidentally injuring someone with her strength, although she did accidentally shatter a chair in the moments after receiving her power. Taylor believed that her speed was just a function of her enhanced strength.

When charged, she was strong enough to pick up a table and throw it like a frisbee. She could easily shove a sturdy, cushioned chair so hard it went flying and shattered against the wall. She could tear the bumper off a car and use it like a baseball bat. She could run straight through solid walls.

She could spend her remaining charge in a burst of electromagnetic energy, letting her move metal objects or pour energy into an item. On one occasion, she used this power to deflect a blade fired by Mannequin. Her power wasn't conventionally Manton-limited. Armsmaster created his EMP attachment by studying her power, which also functioned as a bug-zapper.
