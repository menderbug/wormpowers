# Skinslip
Skinslip has the ability to manipulate his own skin and regenerate. He can extend this ability by flaying people and stitching or stapling their skin to his own. Skinslips' regeneration connected the tissues and extended his power’s breadth and reach, but it didn’t prevent all rejection or decay, forcing him to replenish it from time to time.

Skinslip has displayed a wide array of uses for his ability. He has used it to climb buildings, break his fall, smother and bludgeon his foes.

It is unknown how his powers would have interacted with Vellum.
