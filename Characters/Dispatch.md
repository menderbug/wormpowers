# Dispatch
Dispatch has the ability to create bubbles of accelerated time that can last as long as their inhabitants have oxygen, as well as enhanced strength and durability. He can stagger his bubble manifestation to give himself superspeed, allowing him to rapidly move in the bubble before returning to real time. In combat, he rushes to his targets and encloses himself with them in his bubbles, taking only a few seconds to "dispatch" them with the equivalent of minutes or hours inside. To outside observers, the bubbles he creates with his power are irregular areas of violent color and space distortion, obscuring the view inside, and out. Further anyone enclosed within is cut off from the outside world as most abilities can not breach the barrier his powers create; this allows him to provide areas for planning sessions,  and to provide emergency first aid. As stated time within the distortion is limited by the amount of oxygen present, Dispatch usually gets around this with dedicated portable tanks.

Presumably, he is placed on the Houston team due to the synergy his power has with Eidolon, giving the Trump more time to swap out powers he needed.
