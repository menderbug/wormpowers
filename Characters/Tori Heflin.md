# Tori Heflin
As part of a cluster, Tori has multiple abilities. Her cluster works on a 'carousel', where one member of the group gains all the power one day, while the rest are weakened.

Tori's primary ability is a telekinetic reel, that can push in or out in straight lines only, and has a max weight of 20 pounds. It is unknown how powerful this would be on a day where her abilities are heightened.
