# Black Kaze
Black Kaze is capable of teleporting by using her weapon's movement. The greater the arc of her swing, the greater distance she can cover with a maximum range of about 50 feet. She is capable of striking an approximately 40 foot radius with ten feet of leeway from her start and end point.

While teleporting, innumerable versions of herself occupy space in the area between her
departure and arrival point, moving for a fraction of a second (not long enough to be seen) which lets her cut people with her ever present katana. Black Kaze has an enhanced physique and is highly skilled in fighting with in depth awareness of her surroundings brought on from years of practice and untreated PTSD.

In actual combat she is able to moderate the swings she makes with her weapon, for example multiple small swings allow for multiple short range teleports. She is also able to strike the ground a hundred times, kicking up clouds of dust, moving chaotically within the created effect, executing available targets with one final swing of her blade, or focus to absolutely shred a single target with a thousand small cuts by teleporting past them.

Her experience left her with a superb connection to her Agent, though this has heavily damaged her ability to interact with others.
