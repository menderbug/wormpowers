# Screamer
Screamer has the ability to manipulate sound within roughly a mile's radius. She used it to amplify her voice, alter it to match others, throw it to speak directly into people's ears, or cancel out sounds she doesn't want to hear. Her abilities also allowed her to hear sounds in any given area.

It is almost impossible to cancel her out as she can transmit sound, and by extension words, through multiple mediums. This includes bone, thus earplugs or earmuffs would be ineffective. She can modulate the sound to the point that people will hear what she is saying as if it is the voice within her head, though she may have been aided in this with Cherish. 
She earned her name as Screamer from a favored tactic of hers, overloading everyone in her range with a deafening jarring scream.

The original Screamer may have has greater control over her power than is showcased by her clones in story.
