# Blasto
Blasto is a "wet" tinker, specializing in creating life-forms, minions, using raw materials. Detailed below; this includes but is not limited to a lab assistant, a pseudo-endbringer and other, non-specified hybrids. He often works with plants, fungi, and animals to create weaponized hybrids, which he uses to wreak havoc upon his enemies. He can use tissue samples to create his minions even from things that don't contain DNA.

Blasto has been operating for a long time and as such greatly expanded from his original tinker repertoire thanks to scanning other parahumans and researching into his power. Additionally, he deliberately makes his creations sterile, as he is warned that self-replicating beings would constitute an S-Class threat which would mean a kill order for him.
