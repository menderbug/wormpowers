# Night Hag
Night Hag is a Breaker who transforms into an altered state in order to access her powers. In her Breaker form, she can transmute her surrounding environment into a special material by 'infecting' it. The longer she stays still, the more the infection will spread. However, the affected area will slowly regenerate after she stops. Her powerâ€™s reach is shallow; she is most effective with materials that stand above the ground's surface.

If Night Hag is destroyed or killed, she can reform herself from any lingering infected ground. That said, it is possible to kill her permanently.

As a Breaker, she has no limit to the time she could spend in her altered state, except for the penalty to her human form that depends on the time spent in Breaker form. Night Hag is a Noctis cape, meaning that a secondary benefit of her altered state is not needing sleep or food. Although unused, she can return to her human form by drawing all 'infection' back into herself.
