# Laserdream
Crystal has a powerset almost identical to her mother - flight, energy beams, and forcefields - but with weaker shields in exchange for more powerful beams and flight.

She could fire crimson beams of energy. Her concussive blasts were judged strong enough to affect Leviathan. One was sufficient to break his grip on her. With continuous fire, she could use them to clear rubble. She could fire them from her hands, or shoot a fan of beams from her fingertips. She had enough fine control to burn a design into clothing.

She could create crimson forcefields,
 but they were relatively weak compared to those made by the rest of her family, capable of being broken when she kicked off against them and dragged around and popped by Leviathan. For example, she could make a spherical forcefield around herself and a partner, a square forcefield to support herself and a partner in midair, or a small forcefield to keep her own lasers from going too far.

Her flight is fast compared to her family, and mostly limited by her own tendency to get motion-sick.

After The Firmament bombing her laser and forcefields became stronger, but less precise in application.
