# Nursery
According to Nursery herself, she is not a parahuman; her unborn child is. To use her child's power, Nursery needs to focus and hum a lullaby without being interrupted. This causes a localized area of space to “blur”into another world. This pocket dimension appears as a hazy indoor setting complete with beds, walls, carpeted floors and stairs superimposed onto the existing environment. During the appearance of the pocket dimension, a music box-like chiming begins, gradually intensifying in tempo and complexity and being joined by the sound of Nursery’s humming from additional sources. Wherever this reality is overlaying something it keeps other powers from working properly.

The chorus of humming comes from distinct sources, located in the baby-carriages among other locations. She can "wake" them, causing wet noises and movement to come from the same locations.

Once she and any accompanying her are through this window, the humming and chiming fade and the window begins to close. She has charges of some kind she looked after. Her power lingers for a bit after she leaves.

If an area has been saturated with her ability enough, surfaces start producing fleshy growths inside them, that can be broken out. Once disturbed, the growths will instinctively attack anyone nearby and try to impregnate them. The growths have a degree of permanence and can be hidden in containers as traps. They will remain even after Nursery has left the area. Nursery has some sense through distant minions, and is able to control them while in vicinity.
