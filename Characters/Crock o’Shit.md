# Crock o’Shit
Crock o’Shit is a Changer whose form is so sensitive that it has a secondary Thinker function. When she is lied to, she can sense these lies due to the reaction she can interpret from her guts, each reaction influences her changer form. Originally her changer form is a ten feet tall ethereal woman, but it grew more grotesque over time, marinating in the falsehoods of the world.

In her current monstrous form, she has large claws and thick, braided skin. She resembles a cross between a mole rat and a wingless bat. She also has hidden sets of teeth and limbs within the folds of her body. It is very combat capable, such that she rarely fights people she needs to employ tactics against.

It has limits as any power does. Her "Thinker" power is distinctly focused on the meaning behind a statement rather than concrete wording, and does not have some absolute truth she came consistently check the answer against. Thus her power cannot function as a danger sense or give precognitive feedback. Further, it can be 'beaten' by exclusionary detailing; a white lie or lying by omission.

Still, she is able to gain information from a lie and give out factual information from it.

She has training and a wide variety of experience from serving in the Marines as well as operating as a licensed hero in the PRT system, a successful crime lord, and surviving imprisonment in the Birdcage.
