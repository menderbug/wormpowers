# Semiramis
Semiramis is the ability to reverse the age of people and objects. She uses this ability to keep her performers in their 'prime', but at the cost of them losing their memories of the time that has been reversed.

She can also use her ability to speed up construction, and is one of the few parahumans who can do this without disastrous side effects.

She has implied that if she wanted to, she is capable of bringing an entire building down.

## After Power Shift
Following the shakeup that changed many parahumans powers, she could partially "unwind" a person, without affecting their memories she couldÂ :"spot weld" injuries. It seems to be a later development.
