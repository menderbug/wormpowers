# The Giantess
The Giantess has scaled up versions of her original self's abilities. Her telekinesis is strong enough to throw several buildings, as well as crushing materials strongly enough to create carbon nanotubes.

Her master ability works on capes and normal humans alike, and from an even greater distance.

Her danger sense has scaled up considerably. She is more resilient than just scaled-up human would be, being able to survive "the hug" from Titan Arachne.
