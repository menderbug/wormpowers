# The Strange Titan
The Strange Titan has an unknown ability to prevent any act that will make an individual aware of its precise location, appearance or activities. This effect extends to people, Thinker powers, cameras and any known form of observation. More than just blanking out awareness, this ability inherently prevents anyone from even attempting to look at the Titan. The only way to know about the location of the Strange Titan is to keep track of the radius of this anti-observational effect.

Additionally, the Strange Titan has the ability to cause invasive horrific hallucinations, causing immediate, overwhelming and potentially permenant psychological damage. The precise nature of this power is unknown due to it being shielded from observation by its first power. All that is known is that it seems to be a projected effect, perhaps in the form of a beam or ray, due to the fact that it cannot penetrate sufficent cover.
