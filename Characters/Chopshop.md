# Chopshop

Chopshop is a gargantuan brute the size of a small building. He is capable of lifting a train car, shrugging off wounds with little bleeding, apparent immunity or resistance to pain on mechanical parts.

In actuality a Tinker his creations work best the larger they are. He has three working Chopshop models. On top of Chopshop Derian is able to create drones that take the form of remote controlled pickup trucks.
