# Accord
Accord is a Thinker whose intelligence supposedly increases in relation to the size and scope of the problems presented to him; therefore the more complex the problem he's given, the faster he can devise a solution for it. This applies to a wide range of applications. From Accord's perspective, his Shard feeds him estimates and information with whatever task he set his mind to.

As a test of his abilities, he devised a solution to world hunger using only a telephone and the internet in less than six and a half hours and in a further nine typed it up into a concise 150-page document outlining how to implement it. His plans are often so complicated, however, that only Taylor Hebert and Cauldron seriously considered using them.

His plans have more direct utility. When he personally directs his ambassadors they tend to win their fights. Further, he can 'accordinate' plans to take out certain individuals. Though his tactical ability in direct encounters is less usable. Being able to create elaborate physical and social traps.

Other Thinker powers can interfere with his abilities; his plans might have blind spots if other Thinkers were to step in.

## Engineering
Accord has a minor sub-talent for creating objects with multiple interlocking parts and a sense of aesthetic harmony. He personally creates all the costumes and masks for each of the Ambassadors, even making the Travelers costumes. His own mask is made of multiple pieces that shift in response to his facial expressions. Similarly, he has created furniture that automatically adjusts itself to the user's weight and posture for maximum comfort, with apparently no electronics involved. This is not a tinker talent however as these are essentially cleverly designed pieces using mundane materials and obeying normal physical laws without physical shard involvement.

## Equipment
Accord's walking cane contains a hidden folded blade. Given time many of his residences will have furniture specifically crafted by him.
