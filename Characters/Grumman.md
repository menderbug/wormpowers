# Grumman
Eric can toggle between two Breaker states; one granting exceedingly maneuverable flight abilities, the other turning him into an immobile artillery platform.

In his mover state, Eric can effectively turn on a dime, moving at roughly eighty kilometers an hour. In one power test, he collected twenty-four of thirty flags in dense four-acre woods in three minutes, losing track of the remainder only when they were moved from their pre-set locations by the force of his wake. He can fly through solid concrete or meet bullets head-on without being harmed.

As a blaster Eric is fixed in place but can project vast numbers of missile-projections. He can level a ten-story building in eight seconds, taken one floor at a time.
