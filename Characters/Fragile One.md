# Fragile One
The Wretch has granted Victoria a Mover power in the form of flight, a Shaker/Master power in the form of an emotion-affecting aura, and a Brute power in the form of a forcefield. 

While fighting another shard within the shardspace, the Wretch showcased an ability similar to Victoria's forcefield. When hit by the other shard, it shattered instantly, but is back seconds later.
