# Cricket
## Personal Sonar
Cricket can hear subsonic noises and thus sense higher pitched sounds than normally possible for humans, such as the frequency that indicated Shatterbird was using her abilities. It is possible she would be able to hear things like dog whistles as well.

Cricket can generate staccato pulses of subsonic noise to act as a form of radar. This echolocation allows her to orient herself in combat; she is one of the few people relatively unaffected by Grue's original darkness. Although Grue's darkness dampens sound, her senses include Shard-assisted sound analysis/hearing.

As an alternate option, Cricket can maintain a pulse of subsonic noises to disorient and induce vertigo in nearby opponents. Even under Grue's darkness, Cricket's maintained pulse can put Skitter's bugs on the fritz: their coordination suffered and their senses began to go haywire. When Grue fired his gun at an oblivious Cricket in close range under darkness, this disorientation effect interfered with his ability to aim. As long as she concentrates, Cricket can even maintain a pulse that cancels out Shatterbird's powers. However, she cannot use her radar if she maintains a pulse. Firing a gun at an aware Cricket can also break her concentration.

## Supernatural Reflexes
Despite lacking superspeed, Cricket has vastly accelerated reflexes. She has enough reaction time to dodge bullets from a target that she is facing and quickly move towards them.

Cricket is less effective at dodging things she cannot see. Although she detected Skitter via a radar pulse under Grue's darkness and swung her weapon at the incoming cape, Skitter still managed to stab her with a knife. Shadow Stalker sniped an occupied Cricket with her crossbow.

While forcing Cricket to dodge some bullets, Shatterbird controlled the flight of a glass shard to hit Cricket.
