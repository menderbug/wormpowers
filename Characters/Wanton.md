# Wanton
Like some Breakers Wanton has an upper limit for the amount of time he spent in his Breaker state. His record is 12 minutes before being forced back, but he would exceed this.

## Breaker State
Wanton is a Breaker/Changer/Stranger with the ability to turn into a localized telekinetic whirlwind, a ghost for all intents and purposes. His form picks up debris and other untethered objects and puts them in orbit around a central point within the storm.

He has enough control of this to transport multiple wounded without actually hurting them. He did this by moving them to the furthest part of his range where affected objects rotated the slowest.
