# Gallant
Dean was an empath capable of generating concussive blasts of energy that could alter emotions in addition to packing a punch. He was somewhat versatile in how he used this energy being able to lob cannonball sized orbs or shoot them from his fingertips in tight beams.

He was capable of inflicting specific emotions on his opponents with these blasts. The effect was unreliable when used on individuals like Hellhound, who were not neurotypical. Tattletale pointed out that being hit multiple times could be debilitating from the constant emotional switches.

Dean was also capable of sensing the emotions of those around him, though he seems to have issues distinguishing between them. Glory girl's aura potentially made her unreadable by Gallant's aura vision.

As an emotion manipulator he would be resistant to, and interfere with, other emotion manipulators. His presence would confuse the emotional topology that Cherish senses as well as being able to harm her with the concussive aspect of his blasts, though not the concomitant emotional manipulation. Further he could target those who were affected by Cherish's emotional manipulation, either dismissing the effect or leaving people debilitated like he can do when blasting people with multiple emotions at once.
