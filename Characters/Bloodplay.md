# Bloodplay
Bloodplay has the ability to shrink to around two inches tall. While in this form, she is capable of flight and can produce a small, foot-long red laser, that cuts without cauterising the wound and is quite potent, casually penetrating metal. She can use this laser at her full size, but it is weaker.

It is possible, given her name, that the 'lasers' she uses are actually pressurised blood.
