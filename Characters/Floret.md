# Floret
Floret creates buds that unfold into complex crystalline shapes based on a timer or upon impact with a target. Despite being no longer than a foot, her buds have a large tool box of potential uses, with abilities like bonding to surfaces, setting touched things on fire, canceling out chemical reactions, and messing with Tinker devices.

She also has an enhanced awareness and processing ability regarding fine detail, essentially a pericog like Tattletale, giving her abilities such as being able to track Weaver's swarm.

Along with the other Las Vegas Protectorate capes, she knows a special sign language that lets her silently pass information to her teammates.
