# Mr. Bough
Mr. Bough has a bio-manipulation ability that allows him to change the bodies of people into grotesque forms. Examples include changing a boy into have the head and limbs of a dog, changing three women to look exactly alike, and aging a woman 40 years.

Mr. Bough creates needles from his body, that he can use to splice the traits of other beings into a person.

As a Titan, his needles effectiveness have increased dramatically. He is capable of fully mutating someone with only momentary contact, and his victims do not seem to be able to revert. Titan Ophion can create monsters that are over 12 stories and taller, towering even over other titans. The needles that he creates can manifest from the ground itself.

The Firmament bombing permanently weakened his power in all its aspects.
