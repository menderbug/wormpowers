# Pwn
Pwns presumably has powers similar to Leet, possibly with some variations. One Pwn's designs for a gun were described as crude, hodgepodge, similar to Squealer's work. It has an excess of openings and gaps and burned hot near the power source. The gun is mounted on a tripod and included a scope. The power source is explosive, violently detonating upon being dropped from a building.
