# Phir Sē
Phir Sē has the ability to make golden doorways back in time a few minutes. This allowed him to travel back and change past events.

He could open the portals in different locations, such as in the air above him or beneath enemies he is watching on a computer screen.

## Time Bombs
He can use his power to double and re-double light for long periods of time, creating powerful blasts of energy when released. While it charged, one of these "bombs" resembled two golden discs floating in midair with energy crackling between them. This photon derived energy is likely mixed with some manner of temporal power.

This technique required a degree of precise timing; when he started it too early he is forced to re-start. If he is killed or his focus wavered too much, all the accumulated energy would be released indiscriminately, destroying the area around him.

During Behemoth's attack on New Delhi, he created a blast strong enough to destroy around 80% of Behemoth's body. He claimed the blast would destroy India if it were released indiscriminately.
