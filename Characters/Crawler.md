# Crawler
Crawler's power is permanent adaptive regeneration. As long as he survives, any injury will heal at incredible speeds. This healed tissue often gains non-human attributes/augmentations and is altered, if possible, to be more resistant to the source of damage.

## Regeneration
Crawler has a core somewhere in his body that contains his corona pollentia. This weak point is where his regeneration stems from; he will die if this core is destroyed. Crawler's core is not located in his brain or the dead center of his chest. Destroying his brain can slow him down, but not kill him.

He could regenerate hundreds of pounds of flesh in a few heartbeats, extraordinarily fast even compared to fast-regenerating brutes. His regeneration was able to reject Flechette's bolt after it was timed to bond on the molecular level to his face.

## Adaptation
Crawler's adaptation is the primary focus of his power, and is the reason he holds his monstrous form. Mechanically speaking, whenever he takes damage and survives, any part that grows back is altered, if possible, to be more resistant to the damage that hurt him. For every X points of resistance, he gains a mutation from a list. These mechanics explain why Coil notes that parts that grow back are stronger and typically have extra features, growths, and/or other capabilities. Note that Crawler does not decide which mutation he gains; all adaptations must be natural and organic.

If he gains enough resistance and/or suitable mutations, Crawler eventually takes no damage from whatever was hurting him. His power does not just provide purely defensive adaptations, but also ones that allow him to defend himself better. Over the course of years, this has allowed him to develop a variety of powerful defensive and offensive adaptations.

By the time the Slaughterhouse Nine attacked Brockton Bay the second time, Crawler's armor is able to withstand the blast of a small nuke, and he can walk unscathed through burning buildings lit by burning white phosphorous. According to Tattletale, Sundancer's orb can still damage him; however, he already has enough durability to survive and thus adapt to it. His internal organs have been rearranged and reinforced with numerous redundancies. He has hundreds of eyes set into his armor, and an enhanced sense of smell that can be used for tracking. His many modular limbs ensure that his dexterity hasn't suffered for his growth, and can even be rearranged to enhance his agility on different forms of terrain. This, along with enhanced reflexes, makes Crawler a surprisingly agile foe.

Crawler has an incredibly strong caustic spit that he can launch at targets. Panacea, struggling to make a counter, described it as consisting of self-replicating digestive enzymes, all floating in a kind of acid.

A nano-thorn barricade deployed by an Azazel killed a Crawler clone when he fully contacted it. However, when an Azazel flung another Crawler clone into the barricade such that only half of him disintegrated, his regrown arm, shoulder, and leg began producing organic nano-thorns. These nano-thorns are just as deadly and could press against other nano-thorns so that neither severed the other. The clone even intentionally disintegrated his other unaffected arms so that they would gain the same mutations. However, these nano-thorns shared the same weaknesses as Armsmaster's technology: an Azazel instantly burnt away his nano-thorns with a laser. At the same time, another Azazel flung the clone into the barricade such that he fully contacted it, killing him as he lacked enough resistance.

He can only adapt when regenerating from damage that is resistible; if he takes no damage or an attack is irresistible, he cannot gain new mutations. Crawler regenerated, but did not adapt, against Scrub's attacks or Flechette's charged shots because they were All-or-Nothing. Indeed, All-or-Nothing attacks would always kill him if they hit his core. Crawler cannot adapt to Trickster teleporting him, nor can he adapt to precognition against him. Imp's power affects Crawler, implying that he cannot adapt to psychological effects.

Earlier in his development, one could theoretically have controlled the damage and resulting evolution to force Crawler to adapt into an immobile shape, allowing one to bury and thus defeat him.

## Shard
During regeneration, Crawler pulls forth a ridiculous amount of energy and mass via his shard's well. As his shard is on Earth, he cannot gain new adaptations if he is in space and outside Earth's atmosphere.
