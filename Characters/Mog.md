Mog has the ability to absorb vibrations, utilizingÂ the energy to induce physical changes including new features, armor and weaponry.
Powers are giving them a form of progressive neural degradation similar to Parkinson's disease.  Mog compensated for this by shifting in redundancies to their nervous system, but this is a delaying tactic.
