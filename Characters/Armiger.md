# Armiger
Armiger has a forcefield ability, that becomes more elaborate the longer it is used. It is seen taking the form of a shield with wings, horns, a lions head, and flags. When it reaches the point of being too fancy to be effective, it will radiate a mental effect out in front of it, the specifics of which are unknown.
