# Rain O'Fire Frazier
Rain has a background of living rough and away from civilization, acquiring skills not seen in urban circles, and talents. Consequently, he has trouble with computers, initially needing help using Parahumans Online and is noticeably ignorant about multi-triggers, although he did know some. Regardless of this he is socially adept.

Rain claimed his powers were fairly mediocre; a blaster power that makes people or objects he shoots with it fragile for a brief time, the tinker ability to make low-quality prosthetics, the ability to spread small amounts of guilt and doubt over an area, and a preternatural ability to catch his balance.

In addition to his powers, he and the other members of his group shared dreams.

## Blaster Power
Rain's primary ability is a blaster power that renders the target fragile. The name of his primary shard is Cloven Stranger. He creates a slightly bent blade of silver light in his hand, which curves in the air when he throws it, like a boomerang. The blades create long silver lines of fragility on the target; if the target is struck, they split along the line. This power is not Manton Limited, but when it does hit a target, it will affect any covering it has before affecting the flesh, such as clothing. The blades glow strong enough to be an adequate replacement for a phone light.

Rain's blades are powerful enough to affect an Endbringer even at their lowest.

On one occasion, he suggested that this is the only one of his abilities that got a "boost" sometimes as part of the multitrigger schedule. However, this wasn't entirely true: he received a boost to this power every five days, but did get boosts to the others according to a longer, more complex schedule. On the days when his blaster power is boosted, the blades he could throw were larger, faster and more numerous, and the lines lasted 10-20% longer.

## Prosthetics
Rain has a Tinker ability that allows him to build fragile, physically weak prosthetic arms. He has a knack for building tactile feedback pads that allow the user to connect a prosthetic to themselves and control it like its a part of their body. He tends to wear two smaller arms while in costume, both connected at the elbow.

He is able to perform basic maintenance on Ashley's arms, but cannot completely repair them. He managed to create some tentacle attachments for Sveta out of the remains of some of Ashley's prosthetics.

This ability comes from his connection to Grasping Self.

## 
Rain described this ability as allowing him to "catch my balance or secure my footing more easily [...] lets me turn on a dime or keep from falling over." He later elaborated that it effectively let him stop and freeze in position no matter what inertia he is under.

He could use it to step out of a moving train and immediately come to a dead stop on landing, or to stand on a slope without slipping, or even float in air for a short moment. It has a cool down time and can not be used continuously.

## Emotion Power
Rain's emotion power spread mild guilt and doubt over an area. Capricorn noted that it is possible not to notice being under its' effects.

Victoria figured out that this ability could be used as a conditioning technique. That is, mistakes made while under the influence of this power seem even worse, so the people under the effect will strive even harder not to make those mistakes again.

While boosted by tokens given to him by Love Lost, his emotion power provides feedback to him, allowing Rain to identify where people are within the space that he is using his power. It also allows him to identify people within a group who are more susceptible to the doubt he gives them, letting him subtly push their emotions and actions.

This ability comes from his connection to Anguished Heart.

## Cluster Group Dynamics
The powers in Rains cluster wax and wane according to a complex pattern, although he believes that his powers are never very strong. Specifically, he receives a boost to his primary power every five days, and the day after a random member of the group receives a boost to a random power.

While searching for the other members of their group trigger Rain used the following keywords, among others: sever, prosthetic, emotion, acrobatics, mover power, emotion-affecting, claws. One member of the multi-trigger group displayed the ability to run on walls, an emotion-affecting roar, and wielded tinker-like metal claws with which they that could tear down doors and other barricades with ease. Another, Snag, displayed advanced prosthetic limbs that doubled as weapons that delivered an intense emotional "charge", and the mover ability to "leap" long distances without moving his limbs. However, Rain noted that Snag's powers would have been muddled-around that day, and his mover power is usually the strongest.

Every night, every member of the group saw the others in their dreams. In the dream visions they were unmasked, and it is possible for Rain to pick up clues about the others' situations and plans.
