# Spree
Spree has a master ability that allows him to produce a large amount of duplicates of himself in a very short amount of time; roughly 15 clones every three seconds. Because of this, he tends to serve as the Teeths front line combatant. The clones rapidly degrade after their creation, ending up brain dead after a few seconds and reduced to pulp within 15 minutes.
