# Paris
Paris is able to create and throw needles that disintegrate material on contact, producing high-velocity shrapnel. He often uses it to generate shaker-esque areas of denial. They are not Manton Limited and can rip through flesh.

He can "charge up" a needle, increasing its size up to that of a railroad spike.
