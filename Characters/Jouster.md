# Jouster
Jouster was categorized as a Blaster-Striker hybrid. Channeled through his lance, several effects could be applied to a target giving him versatility in attack. These effects included "concussive blasts, fire, ice, lightning, suction and disintegration, among other things." However, for them to apply, he needed to hit the target with the end of the lance.

To assist with this, Jouster had a secondary Mover ability that gave him a short-lived burst of speed. This allowed him to quickly close the gap with his target to more easily strike them with the lance.
