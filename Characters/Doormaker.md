# Doormaker
## Primary Ability
Doormaker can open and close portals between places he has sensory awareness of, including between dimensions. He has some degree of clairvoyance as he sees into other worlds to an extent.

On May 1st, 1988, he in combination with Contessa created portals to New York, Chicago, and the Cauldron Compound.

In combination with Clairvoyant, Doormaker normallyÂ used his power to transport members of Cauldron wherever they needed to go and is effectively the gatekeeper to their facilities. His power allowed Cauldron to pick up test subjects, that would become Case 53s, from everywhere, but Earth Bet, and dispense them in desired locations after the transformation.

## Vulnerabilities
Doormaker unfortunately perceives too many worlds at once, which negatively impacted his life. By May 1988, he is functionally blind and deaf. Legend speculated this is because of too much exposure to Clairvoyant, who has great synergy with Doormaker.

He cannot move or drift his portals as they are anchored to the rotation of the planet. Doormaker's power appears to be confined to the limits of Earth's atmosphere. If Doormaker dies or the well of energy he drew from ran dry, then his portals would start winking out of existence.

Large amounts of energy can disrupt Doormaker's portals, including Ash Beast's power. His portals collapsed when the edge made contact with lava. Significant disruptions to his portals can cause Doormaker to experience pain.

## Other Abilities
Doormaker is considered to be a Noctis type cape; he does not need to sleep and can function without any significant detriment.
