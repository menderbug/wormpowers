# Halo
Halo generated a five-foot-wide, sharp-edged gold hoop that he could move at will, and which could generate forcefields and lasers. He could use this to fly, but preferred to stay on the ground during combat.

His lasers were continuous beams of golden light, and he could generate multiple beams at a time.

His forcefields were immobile and generated around the ring; in order to protect himself he had to recall it to his side and remain in one place.

It's possible that he could vary the size of the hoop, but even at its largest and under the influence of Vista's power it only reached twice its usual size.
