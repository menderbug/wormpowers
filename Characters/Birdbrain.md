# Birdbrain
Birdbrain is a clairvoyant thinker with a specialized understanding of anything above her. She has what is described as 'top-down clairvoyant awareness'. 

Is extra efficient with a gun. While using a gun, she moves it normally from left to right, but almost instantaneously up and down. This means, if she aims, shes guaranteed to get a hit if the guns at the right point horizontally, as she will automatically be able to make any headshots.

Victoria Dallon thought she may have been an All-or-nothing threat because of this, but this is up for debate.

She is also capable of hearing what people are saying, at a distance.
