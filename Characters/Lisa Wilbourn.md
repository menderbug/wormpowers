# Lisa Wilbourn
Lisa is best described as a "pericog", or short-ranged clairvoyant, having the ability to accurately infer and extrapolate an incredible wealth of information from the smallest piece of data. She needs to have some information about the target to begin with, and from there her enhanced intuition fills in the gaps in her knowledge, allowing her to (among other things) crack computer passwords, profile and "cold read" people around her, and make predictions about the most likely outcome of a given situation. She's very accurate, although not infallible. She has to consciously direct her power, needing to refocus and starting again if she gets useless information. She can become mentally overloaded if she tries to take in and analyze too much information all at once. Further overuse of her power leads to severe migraines, a common issue for many thinkers.

It should be noted that although Lisa's ability allows her to extrapolate information, she finds extrapolating information about people very difficult. At one point she tells Skitter: "Reading people with my power is hard, reading into their motivations or emotions is harder" although this is while Taylor is still pretending to be an undercover villain and Lisa is aware of this, making it highly unlikely this is a genuine limitation. Still, her passenger drives her to try and reveal secrets. Her power developed over the course of the story but she continued to struggle with headaches. Following periods of intense headaches she is unable to use her powers.

Like Taylor she has inexplicable finesse with a gun. At a much later point she is even able to accurately read lips.

According to Glaistig Uaine Lisa hosts the "negotiator" shard.

## Equipment
Lisa keeps files and charts on many threats. Her computer files are kept in quadruple variations with multiple inaccuracies between them, her inherent power allows her to intuit the correct information from it.
