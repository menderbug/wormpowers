# Rail
Grants temporary invulnerability while moving touched targets or self a set distance.

After touching an object, Sadie can move the objectÂ a set distance of forty-three feet along any horizontal plane. While moving, these objects are largely resistant to damage, though some affected materials were noted to have scuff marks after some heavy collisions. Small, hand-held objects move at roughly seventy-five miles an hour, while objects the size of a car move half that speed.
