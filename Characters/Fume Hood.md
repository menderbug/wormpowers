# Fume Hood


Fume Hood creates fragile spheres of poison that explode on contact with hard surfaces, creating weak concussive blasts strong enough to knock a person over and a splash or cloud of poison. The spheres are solid and about the size of a billiard ball. Their color depends on the potency of payload, ranging from yellow to yellow-green and further into black.

The strength and properties of gas can be varied, usually being stronger if concentrated into liquids, when it can affect on skin-contact. Apple predominantly uses poison that only strong enough to make a person nauseous and slightly feeble, 
but she is capable of ratcheting the lethality of gas to the point of melting organic objects on contact. She never used these.

Apple can recall already expelled gas by forming new projectiles. She also can dissolve the already formed spheres, however it takes some time.

She has some control over the spheres, able to launch them in straight lines at the record-level pitcher speed, course-correct them mid-flight, or make them orbit her hand in an ellipse. She can manifest multiple spheres at a time and send them all at once.




As Titan Eve, her physical range and durability have drastically increased, due to her new and giant non-human physiology. Titan Eve produces gas that fills the area in a radius around herself. Titan Eve has full access to all potential abilities provided by her Shard. Titan Eve can control this gas to a greater extent than Fume Hood, solidifying it at will into various shapes that she can in turn manipulate. She uses this ability to solidify her gas into weapons, launching spikes of hardened gas at opponents. When those solidified projectiles collide they have a corrosive shrapnel effect, producing a heavy, but localized damage.

Titan Eve can alter the properties of the gas she produces. Including a gas with a bubblegum pink hue to it. This gas erodes holes into whatever it contacts, from which pink and green maggots with sharp pincers can form. These creatures can be as big as humans. The holes formed by this gas have some extradimensional nature, as they do not significantly compromise the structural integrity of whatever they form in.
