# Scrub
Scrub's power constantly generates beachball-sized spheres of energy in his immediate vicinity that manifest as flashes or bursts of white light. According to Tattletale, Scrub's shard finds a parallel Earth with roughly corresponding architecture, swaps more permanent elements of this architecture in as needed, and shunts any remaining matter caught in these blasts out to that parallel Earth. Thus, his spherical explosions appear to delete matter but typically leave the ground and buildings intact because they are effectively portal cuts that also swap select elements in to avoid tearing up his own footing. This behavior explains why his power is far less likely to accidentally destroy a critical support that collapses a building onto his head.

Scrub's spheres of energy are All-or-Nothing; their shunting/swapping of matter cannot be blocked by any non-perfect defense. This allows his explosions to ignore the defenses of Alexandria, Crawler, and the Endbringers. He presumably can pop the Siberian (i.e., the highest level of invulnerability) like Flechette and Damsel of Distress can.

Scrub can push his power into overdrive to generate explosions more frequently.

## Vulnerabilities
Scrub's power is heavily interdimensional, resulting in his power being always on because of increased shard involvement. As his power is also relatively unbounded, he has limited control over his power as the placement of his explosions is somewhat random. To avoid any friendly fire, he must keep his distance from his allies. Scrub cannot really control where his blasts hit with any degree of accuracy as he only has some ability to dictate their general direction and frequency (i.e., spam a general area). When fighting against Shamrock, he is unable to hit her despite being in close proximity and pushing his power into overdrive.

His power has relatively short range. On one occasion, an explosion occurred within 10 feet of him. Scrub's range is presumably no more than around 20 feet as Shamrock dismissed him as a threat at this distance.

Although Tattletale speculates he would be assigned a high Blaster rating, in reality the PRT stayed out of his range and just trapped him in a hole to neutralize his threat. Indeed, his power never blasts the ground out from under his feet; Scrub's shard presumably sets this limit to avoid hurting him.

If an explosion contacts an All-or-Nothing effect, they presumably will nullify each other as demonstrated by similar scenarios.
