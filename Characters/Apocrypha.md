# Apocrypha
Apocrypha has very similar abilities to her original - flight, strength, and invulnerability. While it is not directly showcased, it can be assumed that she also has her source's Thinker abilities.

Like Alexandria, Apocrypha's invulnerability didn't defend against abilities that made heavy use of interdimensional phenomena, such as Scrub, Damsel of Distress, Foil, or March. Eidolon made use of this vulnerability to destroy her.
