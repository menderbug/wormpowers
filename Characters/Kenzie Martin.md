# Kenzie Martin
Lookout is a dual field tinker who has stated specialties in cameras and immobile terminals, with little ability for offense or defense.
Her former team leader Houndstooth, however, describedÂ her as a (counter)surveillance tinker.

Her power is useful, so much so that she worried she might be kidnapped by people seeking to exploit it. Chris stated that she would make a terrifying villain should she choose to.

Kenzie is able to construct a parallel Parahumans Online server, giving her a faster connection and allowing her to view private information on the site. She also constructed a group of relatively sophisticated chatbots (see Treefort above), although she stated that this is not her specialty, and she is not capable of creating true AI. She claimed that she would likely be able to construct immobile teleportation terminals, although they would require regular maintenance. She could fix her devices and make them work better simply by hitting them, likely assisted by her Tinker power. She claimed that she could probably defuse a bomb, provided she is there to do it and not over a phone or similar.

Kenzie took pride in her skill at paperwork when she is with the Wards.

## Equipment
Kenzie has a tinker workshop she used to work on her technology, first located in Baltimore and later at her home. It may have been the same workshop used to maintain Sveta's prosthetics. Her workshop needed to "warm up" before she could use it, so she would call ahead to have her parents start the process.
