# Cache
"Cache can force objects into an extradimensional space, or remove them from one."

His power appears to be an area of effect. First, "Dark lines, ... forming complex geometric angles." and then "Panes of glossy black material snapped into place between the dark lines. Â The resulting geometry contracted."

There is some backlash if his powers are counteracted somehow, as he suffers from a nosebleed after the Siberian breaks his construct. This may be just due to power interaction with the Siberian.

He is also able to use the power on himself, though it is unsure how he would be able to return.
