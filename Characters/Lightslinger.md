# Lightslinger
In Lightslinger's hands (almost) any light is converted into a concussive Laser cannon. The brighter the light source is, the more energy he can shape and direct. While his power can easily be lethal, Lightslinger can moderate the output to less than lethal levels. He can choose to either adjust the output and intensity of one light source at a time, or he can amplify every available light source at once, to devastating effect.

Lightslinger typically has LED lights on his costume  and flashbangs to provide lumens for him to work with.
