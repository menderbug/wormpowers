# Vista
Vista has the ability to distort non-living material by stretching, compressing, or bending it.Â  Her power is extremely versatile; she can shrink part of an object, like the leg of a chair or the wheels of a car, or manipulate nearby terrain to create huge "treadmills" to keep people from coming closer to her. The presence of living creatures interferes with her ability; in the absence of people, her power is potent enough to alter continent-sized regions of terrain. Her powers appear to involve warping spacetime rather than matter itself, as she can create regions of space which cause projectiles passing through them to be redirected. However, her power and reflexes are too slow to actively deflect projectiles.

As with many Shakers, time is a crucial element for her. The more time she has in a particular area, the greater the amount she can shape.

Vista's power provided her with a mental map of the terrain. She usually needed solid matter to "anchor" her power to. She is able to target specific objects, which remained small and lightweight until her power wore off. Because of her skill at using her power, especially compared to other shakers in Brockton Bay, she is classified as a Shaker 9.

Interestingly, her powers seem to confuse some thinker powers and computers.

March believed that Vista is neglecting the more subtle aspects of her power. Ironically, Vista used a more subtle aspect of her power to assist in defeating March; she shortened March's blade, which screwed with her timing.

## Power Synergy
Vista can anchor her space-warping effects on projections and tools vastly increasing their size. She can also do this by manipulating the space that matter creation and energy occupies to either decrease or increase the effected area. The parahumans may find this effect difficult to work around.
