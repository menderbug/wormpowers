# String Theory
String Theory is a Tinker similar to Leet in that she has very few limits or specialty restrictions on what she can build. Her creations worked on a countdown timer from the moment construction began, requiring careful time management and sufficient resources in order to achieve the best results. When the conditions of time or resources weren't met, her creations would backfire.

She claimed to be able to work extremely rapidly as a result of having has four years to design new technology in her head while imprisoned. As a result, she is able to complete the G-driver within the span of only forty-three minutes. This is later expounded upon to be due to loaned time manipulator capes and her construction of specialized drones to do the construction for her.

Her Driver weapons were extraordinarily powerful, capable of significantly injuring and even potentially killing Endbringers. As a result, the Endbringers coordinated their appearances so they would never face her devices in combat.

## F-driver
The F-driver, short for "Firmament-driver," is a powerful weapon created by String Theory. Not much else is known about the weapon other than that String Theory threatened to use it to knock the moon out of orbit.

## G-driver
The G-driver is a weapon designed for combating Scion. It is an upgrade of the F-driver, hence its name G-driver. The name is also meant to stand for "God-driver."

The G-driver is operated remotely from a laptop during the oil-rig battle. It fired at Scion through one of Doormaker's portals, and targeting is further refined from the laptop using coordinates provided by Number Man. Due to the mechanics of String Theory's power, the firing time could not be changed and is set down to the second.

In operation, the G-driver's payload shot a beam that resembled a bug zapper. The shot is able to fling Scion out of the atmosphere, although it failed to damage him in any meaningful way. The G-driver is incredibly destructive, being shown to destroy an area of a city a fifth of a mile wide with a single shot, pulverizing the buildings into small chunks.
