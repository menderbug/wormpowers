# Flapper
Flapper has the ability to alter and extend her clothing. Using her power, she can form the sleeves of her costume into large wings that she uses to fly by riding air currents. She can also alter her wings to give them 'middle fingers' that she uses to attack from above. Her wings can be used as barriers to block enemy fire.
