# Barfbat
Barfbat is the type of changer, self mutating tracker. For example, he can fly with the help of wings and strange inflatable tumor-like growths. He can also make a slit appear down his face, resembling a bat's nose and aiding him in finding people with its associated super-smell. This is presumably the source of his name.

He is also noted to have enhanced hearing.

Barfbat has superhuman vomiting abilities, able to vomit much more and much harder than any human being can. He also can shoot a loogie, with the speed of a bullet.

Barfbat is a regenerator, capable of healing a bullet wound within seconds.
