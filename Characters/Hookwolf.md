# Hookwolf
Art by Scarfgirl
Hookwolf can transform into a shifting mass of hooks, blades and other weapons. He prefers to assume of the form of a large wolf-like creature, but is not limited to that shape. Under the influence of Jacob, Meadows began showcasing his versatility assuming forms like a Wolf-headed serpent or even an amorphous glob of blades. Even when he appeared human, Hookwolf had metal encasing each of his muscles.

Hookwolf perceives his power as him pushing metal out from a 'core', into which he can draw his fleshy human body for protection. Hookwolf's eyes still remain human, but are protected by a shifting screen of blades. It took energy for him to create this metal, although he was able to "recycle" it by drawing it back into his core.

His alternate form can take an amazing amount of damage, being torn in half by Leviathan. However, when this happened, the 'core' remained undamaged. This allowed Hookwolf to shift his remaining half back into his unscathed human state.
