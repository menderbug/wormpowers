# Butcher
Butcher I had increased strength and durability, a ranged agony-infliction aura potent enough to induce cardiac arrest, and the ability to transfer a watered-down version of his powers and a share of his consciousness to his killer, making them the next Butcher.

While no two powers from independent shards are the same, if Butcher does get multiple copies of the same power, such as from a bud of a shard, they will stack. 

A succession of fourteen different parahumans have added their own abilities and minds to Butcher. In addition to granting more powers, the Butchers' minds will drive a successor insane if they are not a member of the Teeth who challenged the previous Butcher and beat them in a fair match. Butcher III, for example, was a hero who was driven mad by the personalities from the two previous iterations. Presumably the effect has only increased with the addition of more voices and personalities.

The Butcher might be more susceptible to emotion affecting powers such as Cherish because of the number of accrued consciousnesses they have.

If the Simurgh (or presumably any other Endbringer) were to kill the Butcher, they would not become the next Butcher. Instead, the nearest available parahuman would become the next host, even if they had no part in the Butcher's death. This implies that only parahumans can become the next Butcher, and not regular people. Note that the idea of Scion (i.e., the Warrior-hub of the shard network) permanently neutralizing the Butcher by killing the Butcher appears to be wishful thinking: specific details are scant but might be different from the scenario where the Simurgh kills the Butcher.

Butcher XV is likely to have access to the following powers:
