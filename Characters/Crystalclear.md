# Crystalclear
Crystaclear has a blaster power that can travel through terrain. He would throw chunks of crystal that passed seamlessly through walls and the ground, then exploded out in a small detonation of gas, debris and crystalline fragments. The crystals seemingly homed in on their targets; for example, a crystal thrown into the ground would re-emerge beneath the target.

Crystalclear saw through solid objects as if they were made of glass or transparent crystal, with edges and corners catching the light. Unmoving objects looked white-edged, while moving objects (such as people) looked blurred and diffracted, their white-edged present selves surrounded by red images of their past and blue images of their future. Humans were also surrounded by distortions in the light that represented their focus and emotions, with dramatic changes in focus resembling fractures in the crystal.

He could see other colors beyond the red past and the blue future. Greens were also present. He could shape the crystals he grows, and they do not interfere with brain function.
