# Shuffle
Shuffle can teleport sections of landscape and only landscape, such as hills or even power effects. Presumably this meant he could transport material that Annex is intersecting with letting the Ward move around more easily.

His power is unpredictable, sometimes teleporting things out as well as in, but he seems used to it, using multiple teleports to shore up gaps.His limited accuracy and control is possibly a result of his passenger punishing him for not using it enough, as the power would be hard to use in normal combat.
