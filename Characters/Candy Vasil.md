# Candy Vasil
Candy is able to induce intense and sensory-complete hallucinations of whatever the target loves most. The intensity and length of these hallucinations depend on how much accumulated "juice" Candy uses on them, with a full dose starting a hallucination that can last 5 straight days. These hallucinations are so intense, that usually the person afflicted will end up hating whatever it is they used to love. If Candy does not use up the juice she has saved up, it will start to unconsciously affect the people around her.

Unlike other capes with emotion-affecting powers, Candy does not have a secondary Thinker power that allows her to read emotions.
