# Professor Haywire
Professor Haywire was a Tinker specializing in "interdimensional tech." He created general tinker-tech creations of power suits and laser rifles that he would outfit himself and his minions with whenever he needed to secure the funds and materials needed for his experiments. Haywire also created things like 'tag' ammunition that temporarily shunted the victim into another reality, along with ammunition that could sink into one reality to get around an obstacle and surface in the original reality to strike its target. Some of his enduring creations were viewing lenses to see what was occurring in other realities and multidimensional portals that could be used to travel between realities.

Because of his powers he was in constant communication with two other versions of himself on alternate Earths. This presumably helped him to set up much of his inter-dimensional technology in the first place. His behavior was influenced by his passenger, forcing him to take risks and enter conflict where he may have been content to stay in a lab.
