# Victor
Victor is a skill thief, with the ability to absorb the practical expertise of anyone he spends time in the presence of. He has used this power to become a veteran martial artist, a computer hacker, board game player, an expert in various forms of gunplay, and many other things. Similarly, he has gained resistance to many master abilities thanks to the absorption of standard PRT psychological counseling, and similarly many master abilities have negligible effects on him. These may be a function of his psychology and not solely due to his power.

This mechanism can act through several paths, such as eye contact or general proximity, with each connection made intensifying the breadth and depth of what he is able to steal, whether a specific skill or imparting a target's general skill set. Barring a complete "robbery" of the skill in question, the victim will completely regain the skill given time.

To clarify the passive wide net skill stealing can be focused to specifically steal one thing permanently.

After becoming a Titan, his power increased dramatically in strength and potency. It affected everybody within a certain radius of himself, effectively giving them brain damage. He also seems to apply his power through objects, including air. The Nemean Titan appears to gain an increase in power or confidence for every person that he drains.
