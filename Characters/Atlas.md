# Atlas
Atlas has the ability of mechanical flight, but could only handle a single full-grown person at a time. It is also durable enough to survive a ten to twelve foot crash without any noticeable damage. However, Skitter felt it is too fragile to survive any hostile actions while in air.

Atlas' large scythe-like talons could also be used as a weapon. Though like his other legs, it is a hydraulic-based system that could not be utilized during flight and vice versa.

## Tactics
As he is essentially a brainless extension of his Master he has no tactics of his own but he is instrumental in several. He is used like an attack drone on at least one occasion.
