# Dredge
Dredge is a psychometric, a post-cog that can draw knowledge from objects and people in his immediate vicinity.

Dredge supports the team as safecracker, and performs other tertiary roles. Largely a noncombatant, he proves more vulnerable than a non-parahuman due to a lack of awareness regarding his surroundings. It seems that the information that his power provides him is making him insensate.
