# Gwerrus
Gwerrus has enhanced strength and a protective ability that allows her to reflect damage, whether physical or powerbased, back onto her attacker. Armsmaster correctly theorized that she either needed to see the person attacking her or that there needed to be some correlation between the person and the damage done. Gwerrus did not have familiarity with her powers, which limited her combat effectiveness.

Myrddin identified her power as a kind of balancer of the scales of damage.
