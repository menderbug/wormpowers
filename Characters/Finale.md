# Finale
Finale creates sonic orbs by pointing and shooting or with throwing motions that concussively detonate when they connect. Victoria described these as "soft" explosions which imparted kinetic energy without heat or damaging shockwave, and they affect both humans and inanimate objects. The more she uses them the stronger her blasts become. Once she has tagged a series of targets, she can unleash a "finale" of coordinated secondary detonations that launch all previous targets in a cascading chain reaction of collisions and further detonations.

The onomatopoeia she makes helps her shape and regulate the initial strength of the blasts. E.g. the proper imitation of a gunshot can put a hole into the gunsteel even at down-low of the overall charge. It also extend to her regular speech, which starts triggering power-effects when her power is restless.

She prefers to delay using the finale as long as possible, as it takes her time to build up a new one, but the finale seems to become less precise as the number of targets and the setup time increase. Some skill is apparently involved in controlling the finale, and she is less experienced with throwing people than with inanimate objects. She is self-conscious and highly critical of her own mistakes with this aspect of her power.

She may have some innate durability.
