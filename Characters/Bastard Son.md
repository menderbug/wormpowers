# Bastard Son
Bastard Son has a Teacher-like power where he can turn a person into a specialist by granting them extraordinary and inhuman levels of skill in an unconventional thing/tool/weapon. For example, a subject skilled with yo-yos could use one outside a building to ascend from the ground floor to the second floor, while a subject skilled with baseball bats could use one to parry bullets, albeit not perfectly. Bastard Son and the recipient of his power do not get to choose which skill is granted as it is completely random. Other known examples of granted skills include roller skates, glass shards, ribbons, paper, ball peen hammers, darts, and fingernails. Wildbow speculates some other examples could include spoons, paper airplanes, and tape.

However, the subject also appears to permanently lose their mind in the process.  His power takes away sanity and volition from the recipient, leaving them highly suggestible so that he can effectively use them as attack dogs. Bastard Son's subjects are more zombie than human and look like people who are incapable of taking care of themselves without human assistance.

Bastard Son is known to enhance non-parahumans and has used his power to have a whole contingent of subjects at his disposal. When meeting with other villains in Oakland, he brought a dozen enhanced bodyguards with him. In one incident, Bastard Son sent three of his subjects to seize a skill thief, alive or dead.

The powers of some skill thieves or copiers can work against his subjects.
