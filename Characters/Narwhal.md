# Narwhal
Narwhal creates crystalline forcefields that have a noticeable violet-blue tint and shine with faint rainbow hues when they catch the light. She can move them at high velocities (40 km/h), though only in straight lines. If the target is within fifty feet of her, Narwhal can create a forcefield that bisects part of the target's body, such as an appendage or the upper body. This is a violation of the Manton effect and a result of her second trigger. Prior to that, she is unable to create force-fields that bisected people.

Her power is strong enough to cut into Endbringer flesh to an extent, yet she also has much finer control, able to use her force fields almost in lieu of telekinesis to manipulate or destroy small objects, capture people, and as a kind of stretcher or platform. Letting her function as a kind of mass transport system if need be.

Narwhal has a limit to how many forcefields she can have active at a time, though she can cancel any existing ones in a split second. When fully on the offensive (and wearing her costume), she can have up to a dozen forcefields as projectiles. Thus, Seir, who can have up to a dozen shadow copies at a time, could produce duplicates faster than Narwhal could hurl forcefields to cut them down.

Attacking her forcefields causes them to light up. They are durable enough to tank an explosion from March's power. However, it is possible to break through or shatter her forcefields with enough force.

Her power is considered to be equally split between offense and defense. Temperature did not conduct through her forcefields.
