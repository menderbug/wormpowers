# Crane the Harmonious
Crane's power involves the creation and use of a bead, orb or sphere that redirects motion/orientation in its area of effect, as well as a keen thinker ability that allows understanding of motion and ranges of motion. The floating 'bead' allowed her to redirect movement in its vicinity. It could also work on powers redirecting things toward a principle target. 

Aided by her secondary power, Crane the Harmonious has a keen understanding of movement and fighting styles and could learn as well as teach the "perfect style" to a given individual, thus she developed a specialized martial art style for herself, given her physiology, powers and combat style, and then did the same for her 'students', training them rigorously until it is ingrained in them. She has many long-term students and other individuals, claiming to be able to deliver results with a willing individual in two weeks. This is not immediate mastery but rather  unrivaled insight and does not physically alter her body, only exercise, stretching and similar will do that.

## Tactics
Her orb gives her authority over existing momentum and thus movement, while she uses it she has a huge tactical advantage. With it she can essentially achieve the type of physics defying movement that is very nearly flight.

She is still restricted to human reflexes even those of a highly trained incredibly athletic woman and with the aid of her bead.
