# Exalt
Exalt is a powerful but limited aerokinetic and telekinetic. To truly use his aerokinetic powers at their optimal he needed to let a charge build up. How fast this charge builds is a differential that can vary from a few hours to several days. With a charge he could draw in the air from an entire city and stagger endbringers, without it his aerokinesis is restricted and much harder to work with.

He used his telekinesis to fly, it is strong enough for him to bring materials with him.
