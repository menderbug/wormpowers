# Masamune
Masamune had the ability to figure out how to mass-produce tinkertech without maintenance issues snowballing out of control. He was able to create the gear utilized by the Dragon's Teeth and top-of-the-line equipment for the Protectorate and Wards, including copies of Defiant's combat engines. He produced nonlethal weapons, although not as good as those possessed by the Dragonslayers.

He also helped produce spare nanothorn knives, although they would degrade in a few days if not maintained.

As of Gold Morning, he hadn't figured out how to reproduce Weaver's flight-pack technology.
