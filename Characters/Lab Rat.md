# Lab Rat
Rat is a Tinker specializing in drugs that temporarily turn subjects into monsters while storing their original form. The drugs trigger a transformation that draws in extra mass, with even water being a possible source. While the transformation can hold off injuries, it does not actually heal the subject. The subject returns to their injured state when the transformation stops. There is no guarantee of complete recovery from experimental forms.

Lab Rat's formulas are geared toward turning people into weapons, with hormones kicking into overdrive and priming their fight or flight instincts. Taylor noted that she is riding a tide of emotion (such as bloodlust and rage) and put herself in danger by trying to reach Scion, even while she knew she could not affect the fight. She is unable to fight this effect even while she is aware of it.

However, he is also capable to work in a more subtle way, for example, keeping violent Birdcage inmates pacified.

As a Field Test Tinker, Lab Rat is only able to work himself to valid results by experimenting on his subjects (either others or himself). He is an extremely fast worker, producing a full batch of his serums within 37 minutes with access to only an animal shelter.
