# Cozen
Cozen could create pocket dimensions much like Circus'. However, she could place these 'caches' in fixed locations, rather than simply keeping them on her person. Furthermore, she is not necessarily limited to inanimate objects as she could also store people in them. Lastly caches placed within roughly 25 feet of each other could form a 'network' where objects could be taken from or an individual could be brought to after a delay. In practice, this operated as a form of slow teleportation.

Her abilities only operated ideally when she has total focus without worrying about her safety or other distractions.
