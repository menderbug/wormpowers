# Ligeia
Ligeia's power has two modes â€” causing geysers of water to gush out of empty space, and sucking water and whatever flows with it back into where the water came from. Her water is drawn from the ocean depths of an alternate reality and, when sucked back up, returns there along with anything or anyone caught up in it.
