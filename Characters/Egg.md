# Egg
## Original
Egg hatches and produces autonomous, shape-shifting minions.

The main minion that he prefers to use is named Rhea. She is a large featherless bird that is around ten times his mass, and has significant superstrength. Rhea appears to be able to track people, and is relatively docile and predictable. He has other minions, named Gobbles and Hurk, who are the size of houses. One looks more lizard-like, and another snake-like. Egg prefers not to release any of them.

His minions seems to feed on his emotions and are affected by them physically.

Egg regenerates his shell almost instantly.

## Later abilities
Following the mass power shift he is able to call forth far more mininons.
