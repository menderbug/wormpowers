# Gentle Giant
Nothing concrete is known about Gentle Giant's powers, but he is mentioned among capes with durability strong enough to warrant being enhanced with Galvanate's power in the fight during the first stage of Gold Morning, making him one of the toughest capes in the story. He presumably also possesses enhanced strength.
