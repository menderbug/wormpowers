# Cuff
Ava is a metallokinetic, capable of shaping most metals to some degree or another. As a Striker, she can more easily manipulate metal in direct contact with her skin, able to wear metal in a semisolid state as Cuff. She can also manipulate metal for several seconds after it leaves her vicinity, giving her the ability to control metallic objects in flight, this allowed her to be an effective long-range attacker. As part of her metal manipulation abilities she can also sense metal to some degree.

Her striker powers allowed her to manipulate metallic objects as she was hitting them, increasing the impact and effect of her punches, with manipulation of her costume allowing her to hit hard enough to break bone, without hurting herself.

Ava also has a passive secondary Brute power that slightly enhances her physique and increases her resistance to damage for a little while after being injured. As stated she uses her metalokinesis powers to enhance the strength of her gauntleted blows as well as her agility, and is even able to deflect metallic objects as they speed toward her.

After the timeskip, Cuff's skill increased to the point of being able to open vault doors with her Striker powers, making her particularly effective against metal emplacements.

## Equipment
Cuff's abilities made any suitably metal object near her a potential tool and weapon. To save time though she was commonly equipped with discusses and similar.
