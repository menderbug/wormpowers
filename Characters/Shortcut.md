He surfed on the blade that allowed him to move at an unbelievable speed.

He is one of Advance Guard's more mobile members. While retreating he is among the last to be evacuated by the team teleporter.

As a Titan, his abilities are hugely upgraded. He is capable of dropping into the ground as if it were liquid, doing a large amount of damage to everything around himself. He can move through the ground rapidly.
