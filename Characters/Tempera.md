# Tempera
Tempera generates a paint-like substance from her body, primarily her hands, and in large quantities if she needs to. This 'paint' has a variety of applications and can be controlled after it is deposited. These applications included hardening, which can be used to seal up a door. It can be used to trap opponents; if an enemy is strong enough to shatter it, it can harden and be broken and harden again.

She seemed to leave paint on things she touched even if she didn't want to, but her ability to control the substance made cleaning it up easy.
