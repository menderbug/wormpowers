# Gully
As a result of her altered body Gully has some degree of enhanced strength, which sometimes caused her to accidentally break things.

Her true power rested in her ability to manipulate earth. She could create a pillar of asphalt in a particular spot without damaging the ground on top. A degree of control that surpasses Tecton's. Weaver believed that Gully's control is enough for her power to dig tunnels through the earth. Her ability also gave her a Thinker awareness of earth, a constant sense of the ground around her.

Gully would sometimes tap her shovel against the ground when using her power, although this wasn't necessary.
