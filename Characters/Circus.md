# Circus
Circus' power granted her superhuman reflexes, balance and coordination, enhanced aim, spatial sense, minor pyrokinesis, and an extra-dimensional storage space, which she used to store a variety of items, potentially including disguises. She is considered a "grab-bag cape" give her wide spread of minor but related powers.

Circus' aiming skills are sufficient to hit a horsefly out of the air by spitting, place throwing knives only in nonlethal areas, and hit her targets without line-of-sight.

Circus is highly practiced at effecting a quick change into costume aided by his pocket space, and has general skills in escamotage.

## Equipment
Circus makes good use of her pocket space, using a garish sledgehammer, accented with matching painted streamers, which she could make disappear after each hit, and reappear in a raised position or while spinning to speed up assaults. She wielded throwing-knives, which benefited from her enhanced aim. Furthermore, she carries disguises, as previously mentioned, and road torchesÂ and similar for a base from which to summon massive fire-balls with her power.
