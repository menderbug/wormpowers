# Rune
Rune could touch an object to attune to it, after which point she has the ability to telekinetically move it. She has to trace signatures onto the object with her power. This process takes a few seconds, up to a limit of 30 seconds. The resultant object did not glow.

Although Skitter believed she is limited to objects weighing up to a ton, they could in fact weigh several tons each, and she could also levitate lighter objects. She is able to levitate pieces of rubble the size of trucks, which were seemingly about her upper limit. On one occasion, she is seen to break off a chunk of a building by using her power on it. She is Manton limited to nonliving objects, although people could ride on objects she moved.

She is usually limited to two distinct objects, but can manipulate three or four with increasing penalties to her own ability to operate independently. Similar objects are easier for her to coordinate then disparate ones.

After The Firmament bombing, she appears to have gained more raw power in exchange of finer control.

Scribe has put years of work into being an effective communicator with a large vocabulary, and has made substantial progress.

## Equipment
After Gold Morning, Scribe took to using a staff to mark down the symbols she used to focus her telekinesis. It also serves as an effective impromptu surf-stick.
