# Blister
Forms subtle bulges of warped space; bulges ‘pop’ on approach, revealing Blister duplicates.

Blister creates patches of warped space, roughly two-by-two feet across, these slightly 'bulge' out distorting and discoloring space. When approached by anyone who isn’t Louis, the bulges pop, revealing a duplicate. Duplicates perish after several minutes, but can re-form into protrusions repeating the process.

As a warped Corona Pollentia can affect the manifestation of powers, Louis's brain tumor has given him a strange new dimension to his powers. Current intelligence has Blister's power being in a transitional state.

His history in the pits has given him familiarity with dealing with situations when he does not know his opponent's abilities.
