# Jacklight
Jacklight is capable of creating globes of light that grow as they fly, then stop in mid-air at planned areas. The orbs have a space-warping effect, some causing accelerating motions in the general area.  This can extend into certain types of energy as well.

The area that the orbs effect may be based on their size. Regardless the orbs are restricted in the area they affect. Further they did not showcase the ability to distinguish between allied and adversarial targets, and their effects may well increase over time.
