# Little Midas
Little Midas has what appears to be a Striker/Shaker ability, that allows him to touch an object with one hand and produce a copy of it with his other hand. These copies are identical to the originals, except for the fact that they are black like obsidian, or onyx. It appears that he can make the copied objects disappear at will.

He is capable of turning the air itself into an object, having been shown creating a statue.
