# Psychosoma
Psychosoma ‘wraps’ people in semi-real illusions of monsters that he directs. The victim is sedated while the effect is in play, the monsters themselves coming in various appropriately horrifying forms with some attributes like sharp claws, strong jaws or being able to crawl up walls, the wrap is brittle however and can easily be broken and when it does the victims emerge unharmed.

Golem remarks that this makes it difficult to deal with a group of Psychosoma's victims because if the effect were broken for one, they would be easy prey for the rest of the pack. This justifies his high rating, given that parahuman powers are based on their danger to the civilian population.
