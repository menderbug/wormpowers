# Miss Militia
Hannah's power is a green and black, semi-sentient blur of energy that can form into ordinary-looking weapons. She can re-summon the weapon at will, collapsing it back into energy.

She can re-summon a weapon if it runs out of ammo, reloading it, or if it jammed. This made it easier to use nonlethal ammunition, such as rubber bullets.

The weapons her power creates vibrate slightly, as if alive. further the energy will flit about, taking the form of various weapons whenever she is on guard.

Her power influences her ability to use the weapons, enhancing her draw time and aim, and subtly adjusting their balance. She was able to accurately shoot a target's head and neck. She claimed that she could re-summon her weapon from someone's hands and shoot the wielder before they could react.

A side benefit of her power is that she doesn't need to sleep,, making her a Noctis cape although she could if she wanted. Even then, she didn't dream, but instead replayed past events over and over in perfect detail. She rarely did so because of her traumatic past.

Following the Shardspace bombing her power shifted in scale, as she was seen manifesting a gun-turret.
