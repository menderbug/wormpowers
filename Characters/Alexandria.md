# Alexandria
â€”Taylor, Cell 22.4
Alexandria is considered the epitome of 'flying brick' capes. The triad of flight, strength, and invincibility reoccurs often enough, in enough variations, that it's frequently referred to as 'the Alexandria package' in honor of her. According to Doctor Mother, Alexandria is one of the strongest parahumans that Cauldron recorded as of 1988.

## Invincibility
Alexandria's body is virtually invincible. She is bulletproof and, unlike Echidna, could survive for nearly a minute inside Sundancer's orb without injury. Behemoth's kill aura, which can ignore the Manton effect and produced a flame hot enough to melt sand into glass, did not burn her. She can even tank Scion's Stilling attacks to an extent.

Alexandria's seeming invincibility derives from her body being in a form of stasis. Although she continued to age and grow when she first gained her powers, Alexandria eventually stopped aging shortly after adolescence. Her nails and hair then stopped growing; Khepri described the broken fragments of her body as being more like a statue than flesh. Pretender believed Alexandria's body was as warped as any Case 53. That said, Wildbow speculated that her skin is still soft to the touch.

Alexandria does not have All-or-Nothing invulnerability as she is vulnerable to Sleeper's storm and did not pop the Siberian. Although she normally feels no pain, she still experiences pain from attacks that injure her. Abilities that make heavy use of inter-dimensional phenomena or are All-or-Nothing, such as Siberian, Flechette, Damsel of Distress, Scrub, March, and Grey Boy, can penetrate Alexandria's defense. Eidolon made use of this vulnerability to destroy her clones. Scion's Stilling attacks could eventually destroy her.

She is not an immovable object as she can be pushed around by external forces:

## Flight
Alexandria can fly at incredible speeds, fast enough to appear as a blur to viewers. She can fly so fast when zig-zagging between buildings that people couldn't follow her with their eyes, though Skitter could still sense her movements with her bugs. Even in Eidolon's time-distortion bubble that slows objects to a tenth of their speed, Alexandria could still fly as fast as a running person, though her arms moved in slow motion.

Doctor Mother claimed in 1988 that Alexandria could fly at speeds that matched Legend. However, Legend in 1988 has not yet tapped his full speed, developed his powers, or tested his limits. During the Battle against Echidna, Alexandria's clones could not catch up to Legend when he purposefully flew in loops and circles to find opportunities for taking aim and firing at Echidna's clones.

During the Battle against Khonsu, Pretender in Alexandria's body, as well as other capes, managed to get from Japan to Cape Verde in under ten minutes. However, Pretender (and presumably these other capes) specifically required the help of Doormaker. Wildbow confirmed that Doormaker cut the distance down significantly without dropping Pretender directly at Khonsu; he did not specify the portal's location.

## Enhanced Strength
Alexandria has vastly enhanced strength; only a few capes such as  Chort could surpass her in strength. She is strong enough to crush concrete in her hands, catch modified fire trucks, and lift the 9-ton Leviathan into the air. Alexandria in  Brockton Bay slammed Leviathan hard enough onto the ground to cause an earthshaking crash.

Using Alexandria's body, Pretender toppled Behemoth hard enough in  New Delhi to tilt the nearby lightning rod created by the  Chicago Wards. At the Cauldron Compound, he also held up a full third of a ceiling made out of steel, concrete, and granite over a single room; this ceiling section that looked ready to collapse was a relatively insignificant part of a 1.73 million-ton structure currently being held up by walls and a column. Pretender could only buy time for Golem to build the necessary supports for this ceiling section because the ceiling slab continued to crack and break down due to its own weight and lack of support in other spaces.

## Other Abilities
Alexandria has near-perfect memory retention, and accelerated processing and learning. She virtually never forgets a detail and can absorb information quickly, such as reading two pages of a book with a glance and retaining everything she quickly picked up. She knew most commonly spoken languages, no less than ten styles of martial arts, and could match some of the best non-tinkers in the world when it came to computers. However, her trigger vision memory slipped away before she could think to recollect it. At high speeds of up to around 30 mph (disregarding whether dragonflies could fly at maximum speed while carrying spiders), Skitter's presumably loud swarm of dragonflies, cockroaches, and spiders could fly into the nose and open mouth of a surprised Alexandria before she could even take a single action.

Alexandria can also leverage her power to effectively sense emotions based on body language. However, those who could hide their emotions through expert training or the use of abilities of their own could still fool her. She could also disbelieve the evidence of her own senses as any human could.

Her shard is the source of her Thinker abilities; her power offloads processing power to the shard. The offloading of her mental faculties renders her immune to the Simurgh's psychic pressure and influence: like other immune individuals, Alexandria presumably does not hear the Simurgh's active scream. That said, Alexandria's brain is not special enough to be a countermeasure to Sleeper. She also is not immune to body control powers such as Pretender and Khepri.
