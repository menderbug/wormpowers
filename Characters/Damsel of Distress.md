# Damsel of Distress
Ashley's power creates chaotic maelstroms of warped spacetime, manifesting as uncontrolled cone-shaped blasts that rip, tear, melt, or disintegrate anything within a range of four to fifteen feet. These 'shotgun' blasts are capable of destroying virtually any matter or construction, and can even damage capes whose powers give them extreme durability, such as Alexandria. The blasts also create a horrible earsplitting noise, announcing her wherever she goes, and produce a strange visual effect when seen full-on. Under rare circumstances, her power can crush pieces of metal or other resilient material into highly-compressed fragments; Ashley has a habit of keeping these pieces as mementos or for their power-resistant utility.

Her blasts generate a massive amount of recoil, causing her to be flung backwards each time she uses her power. Ashley eventually learned to use this effect to move at high speeds in ten- to fifteen-foot bursts, allowing her to avoid attacks and giving her a Mover rating. Her power is inherently unpredictable and difficult to control, but some gestures and movements generally produce the same result.

Ashley's power is extremely potent, of the same class as Scrub and close to Flechette's. Yet she never had full control of it, being unable to prevent herself from producing minor flare-ups whenever she became stressed or anxious. Bonesaw's alterations gave Ashley the ability to control her power, along with added range, at the cost of her becoming even more of a monster.

Completely removing her forearms affects her ability to use her power.

## Manton Effect
Thanks to the safeguards inherent in shards, Ashley is protected against her own power. However, it still has an effect on her hair; using her power for the first time turned her hair white, and repeated uses will remove hair dyes.In this way, it can also be used as an impromptu hair-cleansing method.
