# Amy Dallon
Amy is a biokinetic with an innate understanding of, and the ability to modify, the biology of any living organism she touches. This is not limited to humans but encompasses all carbon-based life based on what is seen in the story. For much of her life, Amy primarily restricted her use of the power to healing. She is one of the greatest healers in the world.

She has demonstrated the ability to render parts of a person's body numb and threatened to give Skitter time-delayed obesity or to make everything she ate taste like bile for the remainder of her life.

Her power is too slow to be much use on Leviathan. It took her "some time" to modify tissues for transplant to avoid rejection, and she can't perform any changes without an appropriate supply of material to use; she can't "conjure material out of thin air". Any changes she makes are not immediate, requiring several minutes to do so and which can increase depending on how massive the change. She also cannot work directly with "dead" tissue, such as hair or fur, and presumably corpses.

Amy is capable of modifying brains. For a long time, she has a firm rule against it, fearing what may happen once she crosses this line. Changes she does make are deep and not easily corrected compared to other master effects. According to Amy, any attempt of neural diagnostics also puts her into the state of, at least, partial shared consciousness.

Weaver compared her in power to Contessa, Glaistig Uaine or Labyrinth. She is not related to Bonesaw.

She is capable of modifying life into entirely new organisms:

## Shard
Amy's powers are the result of receiving a bud of the Shaper shard from Marquis; Amy calls her shard Princess Shaper. However, Amy's powers have fewer limitations and are more broad in comparison. Thus, Glaistig Uaine claimed Amy's shard in particular (i.e., not Marquis's shard) is on par with her own shard and Taylor's shard. Glaistig Uaine also believed Amy's shard, which she called the shaper, would be partly responsible for cleaning up the cycle in its end stages.

Glaistig Uaine speculated Marquis's shard is an artist; the same presumably applies for Princess Shaper. As Amy does not really participate in conflict, her shard is dissatisfied with its host. Princess Shaper appears to express its unhappiness with subtle nudges such as Amy's intrusive thoughts about leaving patients to suffer or die. Amy's powers are also more leashed to the goodwill of her shard than others, especially since her powers are relatively unbounded. For example, Amy believed it is easier to create the Gibborim Knight than to fix her sister. That said, she is not sabotaged to the same degree as someone like Leet; Amy is not a good example of a shard forcing their host to do new things even if they do not want to.

Although Glaistig Uaine did not imply Amy's shard is from Eden, the appearance of Victoria's mutated form (i.e., reminiscent of Eden's flesh garden) might have been inspired by something Amy saw during her trigger event. As Amy triggered near Victoria, her shard presumably got a memory from Fragile One about Eden (i.e., Victoria's shard pinged off Gallant's shard).
