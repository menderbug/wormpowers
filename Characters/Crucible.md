# Crucible
Crucible is able to create a pale blue forcefield bubble that can flare an intense orange white filling it with intense heat, incinerating everything inside. He hides the latter aspect of his power to maintain his reputation as a hero.

His power seems specifically restricted to spherical shapes as he can create domes and bubbles, but is not shown to make any other formations. His forcefieldÂ bubbles could also be used simply to contain or shield, without the incineration effect.
