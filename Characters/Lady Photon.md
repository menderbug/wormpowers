# Lady Photon
Sarah has the ability to fly, create energy blasts from her hands, and create forcefields.

She could gather energy in her hands, which she "spent" to shoot sprays of laser blasts. She is strong enough to blast through Marquis' bone plates in one shot, and has to hold back to avoid firing through them and accidentally harming a teammate. People reacted as if they were punched when hit. Even fired individually, several successive blasts were enough to beat a person to a pulp.

Her shields were broad enough to protect other people, described as a "wall of light", transparent.

She has demonstrated an ability to use her forcefields as a first-aid measure - shaping them to cover a wound - though they are rooted in place unless she makes them a bubble around herself.. She could create a small forcefield to help her lift someone.
Her powers are more rounded-up compared to powers of her kids, who are more specialized.

She is resistant to blinding lights in the same way as her sister, and additionally can see in the dark.

She is responsible for honing out fliers formations, which later will be incorporated by PRTCJ via her daughter. Sarah and her kids also used their forcefields as a form of coded communication.
