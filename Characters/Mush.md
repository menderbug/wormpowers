# Mush
Mush is a Changer, formerly classified as a Shifter, who can form an expanded amorphous or vaguely humanoid body out of loose debris. His body can divide, stretch, fork out and reconfigure itself into a mass of tendrils (not dissimilar from a mass of veins and arteries) that attach themselves to loose matter, such as dirt, compost, junk, sand or mud.


His body then brings this loose matter together around his body, allowing him to craft himself a harder and bigger body. He can also redistribute it across his body, so that if his arms are loaded with debris he can move some of it to cover his torso or head instead.
