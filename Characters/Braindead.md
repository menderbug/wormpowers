# Braindead
Braindead is a thinker who gets a clairvoyant, and possibly clairaudient awareness of a pre-designated area on an x-y-z plane. Anyone within this area is assessed with his power. The things assessed are traits like fitness, martial arts prowess and run speed. The smaller an area that he maintains awareness of, the more accurate information he will get.

He is completely incapacitated while his power is in use.
