# Shén Yù
Shén Yù is Thinker who is able to see incoming attacks through a form of pseudo-clairvoyance in theaters of conflict. In fact he is capable of managing a nigh-instantaneous counterattack when Khepri opened portals into the Yàngbǎn's world. This may well have been from in built fall backs he trained into his subordinates.

Another benefit to his abilities is having beyond expert level tactical sensibilities with talent in regards to the actions of large groups of combattents. Making him a immanent part of the Yàngbǎn successes.

Conversant in English and Mandarin Chinese, and possibly more.
