# Heartbreaker
Heartbreaker is a Master with the ability to manipulate the emotions, any emotion, of anyone within his line of sight. While his range is shorter and more limited than those of some of his children, the effects of his emotional manipulation are stronger and can be long-term or even permanent, continuing even after his death. The psychological effects of his power are so powerful that his thralls are willing to die for him.

Due to being a emotion-controlling Master, Heartbreaker is unable to effectively manipulate capes that experience significantly dulled emotion, such as Regent.
