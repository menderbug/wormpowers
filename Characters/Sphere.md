# Sphere
Sphere's tinkerÂ specialty allowed him to create drones that let him in turn create bubbles ideal for sheltering occupants from innumerable hazards. He could theoretically make huge bubbles capable of holding cities and even started a project to get a whole moon base operating.

Alan specialized in large projects as a type of architect tinker. He primarily worked through automated constructors, which, as they were not self directed, required his attention to keep on target. He has several processors that would consume resources to create the various materials he would use, such as ceramics that were selectively electrically conductive.
