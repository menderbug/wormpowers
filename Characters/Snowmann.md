# Snowmann
Like the original Mannequin, Snowmann is a Tinker specializing in sustaining life. Unlike the original, Snowmann worked almost exclusively with ice to augment their technology, a result of Winter's influence. Snowmann also possessed a slightly weaker version of Winter's power, able to slow projectiles and slow down movement and reactions when in range.

Snowmann's ceramic armor contains highly pressurized ice, causing ice to spew out upon being punctured, encasing and entrapping anything nearby. A similar design is used to surround an entire building during a previous hostage situation, and is almost certainly Snowmann's work. Offensively, Snowmann utilizes heavier, uglier blades than the original Mannequin, more akin to axe blades than knives. They also have chains that they can use as a grappling hook to move around.

Perhaps because of their suit, Snowmann is quite strong, able to throw a Hatchet Face quite easily into a mass of heroes.
