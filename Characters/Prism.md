# Prism
A Master who can split herself into three temporary clones. As long as just one survives, she'll live.

She can re-absorb her clones in a flash of light to enhance herself, allowing her to deal "crushing" blows to her opponents. This enhanced her strength, speed and durability, and possibly other attributes. However, it only lasted for a few seconds.

Her clones retain the same equipment. She can choose to have them materialize without such baggage, however, allowing her to escape restraints. It was possible for her to accidentally bring things along she wasn't aware of; Skitter speculated that she had to consciously choose to exclude objects from being copied.
